They meet again in Pistoia on Feb. 3]\n$$HEADER$$_February 14, 1894\n12 Lungarno Acciajuoli, Florence\nIt is a \u201cturning-point\u201d, I suppose, to be thirty years old, as I am today. Well, we spent 15 l. extra in celebrating the festa, for we took a long delicious drive in the sunshine, and went to Doney\u2019s to dine and had such a bottle of Montepulciano as it entereth not into the mind of man to conceive!\nBut I must go back eleven days  when we met again at Pistoia after nearly two months, which I had spent chiefly in being ill, alas! and Bernhard had spent in reading: Garpari\u2019s Italian Literature,\nD\u2019Ancona\u2019s various writings, XIII century Italian poetry, many \u201cSacre Rappresentazioni\u201d,\nBrowning\u2019s Guelfs and Ghibellines,\nPennington\u2019s History of the Church in Italy,\nUlmann\u2019s Botticelli,\nSabatier\u2019s Fran\u00e7ois d\u2019Assise,\nSchmarsow\u2019s Giovanni Santi,\nHowells\u2019 World of Chance,\nand Scott\u2019s Antiquary,\netc., etc. \n[p6] \nWe \u201cdid\u201d Pistoia on Saturday the 3rd, and found our taste much changed since two years ago.\nLorenzo di Credi\u2019s altar-piece seemed dreadful this time, in spite of our remembrance, which was of something charming, and the Hospital frieze was horribly glaring and out of tone. On the other hand, we enjoyed Gerino\u2019s Peruginesque feeblenesses more, and found a font by Giovanni Pisano which we really enjoyed. We took an afternoon train to Florence. \nThe next day <Feb. 4> we had a glorious walk.\nOn Monday <Feb. 5> I went out to see \u201cVernon Lee\u201d, and on Tuesday <Feb. 6> I felt ill again, and have been so ever since, scarcely venturing out at all, except to meals. \nFabbri came one evening to call, and Miss Paget and her friend came to look at Bernhard\u2019s photographs one day. \nFor the rest, I slaved over copying my \u201cHampton Court Guide\u201d. \nBut the \n[p7]\ngreat event is that Miss Paget thinks Bernhard has made a great, great discovery in aesthetics, and has spurred him to commencing a book on Scientific Art Criticism \u2014 a book which, she prophesies, will make its mark. <this paragraph marked with a red line in the left margin>\n$$HEADER$$_Feb. 15, 1894, Florence\nBreakfasted as usual with Bernhard, and spent most of the morning reading aloud Vernon Lee\u2019s articles of 1880 and 1882 in The Contemporary, concerning \u201cComparative Aesthetics\u201d and \u201cImpersonality and Evolution in Music.\u201d They are brilliantly written, and show an active, eager brain, but a hopelessly unscientific one. She has no method, so her Einf\u00e4lle come to nothing \u2014 in fact, lead her into vague, false, shallow generalizations. I do detest the \u201cvegetable\u201d analogy for art, and \n[p8]\nher whole theory of the growth, blossom, and decay of art is based on this false analogy. \nIn the afternoon Bernhard took Miss Thomson to see the Botticelli drawings, and Mrs. Hapgood, the mother of \u201cFafnir\u201d and Norman, called upon me. She is as eager for experiences and for getting enjoyment out of art as a girl. I like her so much. \nThe other day when Bernhard was walking by himself \u2014 I have not been able to walk, all these days, alas! \u2014 he saw a cloud hanging on the Fiesole hill just like a cobweb, looking as if a feather broom of cosmic dimensions should be employed to sweep it away. \nO, I forgot to say that The Nation, having accepted his article on \u201cDante\u2019s Visual Images,\u201d refused the review of Ulmann\u2019s Botticelli, which I then made use of to send to Mr. MacColl to \u201cplace\u201d for me.   \n[p9] \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, Feb. 16, 1894\nIl Palmerino, Maiano\nBreakfasted with Bernhard and discussed, as we usually do, the relation between the personality of the artist and his inherited and acquired form of art-expression. \nBernhard had lunched with the Hapgoods and walked with Mr. Hapgood from Fiesole to Settignano, and I came here in the late afternoon. We looked at Botticelli photos and talked in the evening. \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, Feb. 17, 1894\nIl Palmerino, Maiano\nA quiet grey day, which I have enjoyed, and would have enjoyed more if Bernhard had been here. I am rather worse, so I lay down practically all day. \nI read Pater\u2019s \u201cPlato and Platonism\u201d,  and \u201cPeer Ghynt\u201d,  and \u201cVernon Lee\u2019s \u201cConferenza\u201d upon Italian painting. \nWe talked too, Miss Paget very brilliantly. An artist came to dinner and talked her nearly blind, but Miss Thomson and I took refuge in Titian photos. Miss T. met Loeser and thought him absolutely detestable. \n[p10] \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, Feb. 18, 1894\nIl Palmerino, Maiano \nAnother quiet day, quiet but delightful. \nRead Henry James\u2019 A London Life,\nwhich Miss Paget thinks fine, and I think detestable. \nRead some Montaigne and Mary Robinson Darmstetter\u2019s poems. \nLooked at Titians with Miss Thomson, who really cares to look. \u201cVernon\u201d hastily rushes through, eagerly searching for the next, which she hopes she will enjoy more than the present one. In the evening she played me XVIII century airs from Handel to Cimarosa, which interested me immensely. \n$$HEADER$$_* Monday, Feb. 19, 1894, 12\nLungarno Acciajuoli, Florence\nMiss Thomson drove me in. \nMet Bernhard at lunch. \nHe took the Hapgoods to the Uffizi and then came here, and we talked and talked. He has evolved an interesting idea about landscape, that, until lately, its visual properties were less noticed that its smell, breezes, airiness, etc. That explains plein air just appearing, etc. \nRicketts and Shannon sent me their \u201coccasional publication\u201d, The Dial. Its illustrations Bernhard said were the progeny resulting from incest between Burne-Jones and \n[p11] \nRossetti. Its prose may be called the bastard of Meredith. In fact, it nearly drove me crazy! \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, Feb. 20, 1894, Florence \nI took Mr. and Mrs. Hapgood to the Bargello. She seemed to enjoy it, but he, like \u201cVernon Lee\u201d, was ever hastening on to try to get something out of the next thing which the last had failed to give him.\nAfter lunch we went to Alinari\u2019s to look at photos, and I hired a piano and got Gluck\u2019s Orfeo as a ginning. I enjoyed reading it over. \nWe found some enchanting tea-cakes, enchanting! \nEmily Dawson came at 7, and she and I dined together at Cesare\u2019s.\nBernhard dined at the Luna, and went to call on the Forbes. \nIt has turned excessively cold. \n[p12] \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, Feb. 21, 1894, Florence\nCalled on Bernhard after breakfast, and then took Emily to see the Botticellis in the Uffizi. \nAfter lunch, we went to the Marucelliana Library and got Landini\u2019s Commentary on Botticelli, illustrated with wood-cuts by some close follower. We thought they were Botticelli, and were awfully disappointed, but tried to see beauties. Pater evidently did the same. \nI called on Mrs. Hapgood later, and then we talked and looked at photos. I had a neuralgic headache all day. \nBernhard dined with Vernon Lee, who talked to him about his book. She wants him to write upon \u201cThe Work of Art\u201d in the abstract, and he wants to write a book upon the Science of Art Criticism.\n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, Feb. 22, 1894\nWent to see the real Botticellis at the Marucelliana and enjoyed them rapturously.\nIn the afternoon Emily and I went to the Certosa and Bernhard took a last walk with Fletcher, who is going to Rome.\nWe came back by San Miniato and enjoyed the view.\nBernhard came in in the evening and said all the arts, except music, are primarily occupied with space composition, even poetry. I \n[p13] \nlay awake half the night trying to refute it. <marked with a blue line in the left margin>\n$$HEADER$$_Friday, Feb. 23, 1894 \nMother and father and Alys all wrote that Knowles has accepted my article on art-criticism for The Nineteenth Century. I am glad, but not elated. I believe my first article in the Woman\u2019s Herald gave me more pleasure. \nEmily and I saw the rest of the Botticelli illustrations to Dante and some buildings, etc., and after lunch the Academy.\nBernhard took Miss Thomson to the Uffizi, and made her wax enthusiastic over: Alessio Baldovinetti!! \nWe took tea in his rooms and looked at Giorgione photographs. They said I had a \u201cGiorgione cranium\u201d. \nI am trying a patent medicine called \u201cOrange Blossom\u201d, and it makes me feel rather bimbly. \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, Feb. 24, 1894\n\u201cStarving in the midst of intellectual plenty\u201d \u2014 is not that the mental condition of most girls?\nEmily and I had a delightful morning seeing the Botticelli at the Ognissanti, and Santo Spirito and the Pazzi Chapel. \nIn the afternoon we took a walk with Bernhard and in the evening chatted. \n[p14] \n$$HEADER$$_* Sunday, Feb. 25, 1894, 12 \nLungarno Acciajuoli, Florence\nEmily went to join her mother in Rome early in the morning. She is a nice girl, in spite of being, as I described her to Bernhard, as \u201cugly as a hornet\u201d. She said I had given her the most valuable present she had ever received in Botticelli and Renaissance architecture. \nThis morning we wrote, etc., and afterwards I finished a Chronicle review of Dr. Ulmann\u2019s Botticelli.\nBernhard lost himself in Pater\u2019s Plato.\n$$HEADER$$_x Monday, Feb. 26, 1894\nItalia, Viareggio \nWe reached here at 3 o\u2019clock and had a walk in the Pine Woods until dinner. \nAfter dinner Bernhard read Justi\u2019s Wincklemann, and I read vol. V of Creighton\u2019s History of the Papacy.\n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, Feb. 27, 1894, Viareggio\nPineta in the morning, pier in the afternoon, a glorious balmy day. \nRead as above. \n$$HEADER$$_x Wednesday, Feb. 28, 1894, Viareggio \nPineta both morning and afternoon. \nI finished a Chronicle review of Leader Scott\u2019s Echoes of Old Florence, and began one on Lafenestre\u2019s Louvre Catalogue.\n[p15]\n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, March 1, 1894, Viareggio\nWalked and read as usual. Went over the Hampton Court Guide, which I finished and made up to sent off tomorrow. We had a wonderful afternoon walk in the Pineta and on the shore. The mountains glowed like amethysts and sapphires. \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, Mar. 2, 1894, 12 \nLungarno Acciajuoli, Florence \nAfter a quarrel (a propos of Bernhard\u2019s nails), which we made up, we had a nice walk in the pine woods. \nBernhard finds Pater\u2019s \u201cPlato\u201d terribly dull, although it is a model of construction. \nWe came back, arriving here at 7, and found various nice letters, etc. \nBy the way, when Emily was here, Bernhard made a comparison worth recording, saying that some remarks are like drawing down those heavy iron shutter fronts they use in the shops here. How much better this describes the sensation than the old \u201cwet blanket\u201d! \n[p16]\n$$HEADER$$_* Saturday, Mar. 3, 1894, Florence\nWe discussed \u201cthe artist in the work of art\u201d over our coffee. Bernhard said that he knew of no case in which the temperament of the artist counted for so much as in the case of Velasquez. \u201cThe artristic temperament?: I asked. \u201cNo, the inartistic temperament!\u201d he replied, explaining that it was Velasquez\u2019 terre \u00e0 terre devotion to the business pf paint that made him so much more powerful than the poetic, expression Murillo. \nAfter lunch Bernhard took Miss Thomson to see some Leonardo drawings, and then we went together to call on Fabbri. \nWe dined at Doney\u2019s. \nI read Boccaccio and Bernhard Sacchetti.\n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, Mar. 4, 1894, Florence\nBernhard walked with Fabbri in the morning, and Miss Thomson came to see me. I showed her some \u201cimpressionist sketches\u201d Ray and Karin made of the Queen\u2019s Drawing Room, and she told me that when she used to go, she used to \n[p17] \nask herself whether she wasn\u2019t crazy, and whether everybody else wasn\u2019t crazy, too to go undressed on cold days, frightened to death, to gain, what? We arranged photos after lunch and read, Bernhard a book by Henry Balfour on the \u201cEvolution of Decorative Art\u201d\nand I Vernon Lee\u2019s Sketches of the XVIII Century.\nI wrote my review of Lafenestre\u2019s Louvre catalogue.\n$$HEADER$$_Monday, Mar. 5, 1894, Florence\nBernhard began Hegel\u2019s Aesthetics\nand music lessons for me.\nI went to lunch at Vernon Lee\u2019s and she played me Handel, Marcello, etc. \nRead in the evening. \nBernhard called on Miss Hallowell.\n$$HEADER$$_* Tuesday, Mar. 6, 1894, Florence \nType-wrote and sent off my Lafenestre review. \nWalked to Bellosguardo and had a heated discussion because Bernhard insisted \n[p18] \nupon making use of such bothersome philosophic phrases as \u201cwill a universe\u201d. I so detest metaphysics and hate the whole incomprehensible jargon in which perfectly comprehensible ideas are dressed up. \nWe had a more amusing talk, when we came back, about his book on Aesthetics. He is going to take the motto \u201ctill out of three notes he makes \u2014 not a fourth note, but a star.\u201d\n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, March 7, 1894, Florence\nBernhard read Taine\u2019s Philosophy of Art, and I finished Vernon Lee\u2019s book on XVIII Century.\nMiss Hallowell came to call and I walked back with her. I liked her, for she makes no more personal appeal than a man. She seems so independent and capable. But fancy the Harvard people giving her as text-books on the Reformation Millman and Principal Tulloch, and never even telling her that Ranke and Creighton had written upon it! \nShe told a characteristic story of Canon Farrar, with whom she and a party went to the abbey one day. His wife came too. At the door she heard this pleasant conjugal altercation. He: \u201cYou \n[p19] \nlook very tired, my dear.\u201d She: \u201cO no, I am not at all tired.\u201d \u201cYes, you certainly are. You had better go home and rest.\u201d \u201cO no, dear, I particularly want to go round the abbey, and I do not feel tired.\u201d \u201cI command you to go home, my dear.\u201d And she went!\n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, Mar. 8, 1894 \nI read Taine\u2019s Philosophie de l\u2019art. \nWe worked a little on the Lotto. \nBernhard feels mentally ill and I physically. \nI took Miss Anstruther Thomson to see the Botticelli Dante illustrations, Ognissanti and Santo Spirito. She attempted to \u201cVeronize\u201d in rather a dreadful way. About the Botticelli St Augustine at the Ognissanti she said: \u201cSee that globe! Doesn\u2019t it look as if the whole great world were compressed into this tiny compass?!\u201d \nAt Santo Spirito she said she thought the floor was the most important thing in a piece of architecture, because the eye naturally saw more of it than of anything else. \nVery hard work persuading her to look at architecture as enclosed space. \n[p20] \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, March 9, 1894, Florence\nBernhard had a painful s\u00e9ance with Anstruther Thomson at the Bargello, when she attempted to \u201cVeronize\u201d him too. He came home sick. \nI took Miss Hallowell to see the Botticellis in the Uffizi, and then went to the dentist. \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, March 10, 1894, Florence \nIt is Karin\u2019s fifth birthday. I celebrated it by going to the dentist. \nMiss Hallowell and I took tea in Bernhard\u2019s room, after he had shown her the Brancacci Chapel. She painted an awfully depressing picture of the Harvard Annex.\nThe words \u2018Ill\u2019, \u2018Cross\u2019, \u2018Miserable\u2019 and \u2018Dentist\u2019 written on the page at an angle and crossed out. \n[p21] \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, March 17, 1894, Florence\nBernhard has gone to dine with Miss Paget. \nI am getting better. The great event, which cheered up our gloom, was the arrival of his BOOK, The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance, clothed alas! in a tasteless gown of Putnam\u2019s devising, upon which we were not even consulted. It could scarcely be worse or more unsuited to what we wanted the book to be! Still it is nice to be published in any form.\n Bernhard has sold another picture to Mr. Davis. I think that is all my news. \nI have just read Howells\u2019 Annie Kilburn,\n and liked it until it began to be a story. \n[p22] \nWas there ever anything more insufferably pretentious and shallow than this, from Norman Hapgood\u2019s last letter? \u201cI also get a bit of science, for the musical criticism of Wagner, Berlioz, or Schumann drives me to (gas about) works on acoustics, as criticism of painting drives me to (talk about studying) the laws of light, architecture to mathematics, and so on in the same old circle of more or less steady (!) interest.\u201d He also talks in the same letter of an ideal set of people \u201cwith a Voltairean [sic] smile on their lips and a load of loathing and discouragement on their hearts\u201d. What an ass a nice boy can be when he is miseducated! \n[p23] \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, March 18, 1894, Florence\nBernhard read Thausing\u2019s D\u00fcrer\n and I read Taine\u2019s \u201cL\u2019Ideal de l\u2019Art\u201d.\nI wrote to Loeser explaining to him why I would not be friendly with him. \n$$HEADER$$_* Monday, March 19, 1894, Florence \nLetters, etc. \nBernhard read Hegel. \nI took Miss Hallowell to the Gallery and she came here to tea. Bernhard drew her out as to her plans. Fancy \u2014 she an Annex girl, and her idea of preparing to teach modern literature was to read say George Meredith and then sit down and write about him, and teach that, and make her scholars do that \u2014 !! It would be awfully funny, but somehow it pains one to think of such mis-education, and all that time and money spent on it. Bernhard talked to her like an angel, and promised to put her on a better track. \n[p24] \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, March 20, 1894, Florence \nWrote innumerable letters while Bernhard read Hegel. \nOne of his friends sent hm a review of his book from the Boston Morning Herald, a most favourable review which says that \u201cevery line is full of meaning and power\u201d. \nJenkyns came after lunch and went with me to get some silver toilet things, a present from Aunty Lill. \nI found a long absurd letter from Loeser in which he says (by way of winning my favour?) that \u201che feels toward Berenson the most vigorous contempt.\u201d He is an ass.\nBernhard went to call on the Forbes. \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, March 21, 1894, Florence\nI took Miss Hallowell to the Pazzi Chapel. She enjoyed it, but seemed to enjoy still more talking about life in general. She told me of a man whom she had refused to marry, an artist, who went to Paris. There, she heard, he had set up a definite \u201cma\u00eetresse\u201d with a view to getting over his feeling for Miss H. She was terribly concerned \n[p25] \nabout this, felt responsible, and finally wrote to him. He replied that it was true, partly for the reason she had heard, but more because he felt he needed more warmth and colour and heart in his work. I advised her to send him Manette Salomon and Sappho to read \u2014 and am going to add to this, Le Roman d\u2019un Spahi.\n Bernhard says such a reply as the young man\u2019s was most characteristically American, for in America young people are always taught that Immorality and Art go together. \nIn the afternoon we went to the Uffizi and looked at drawings and engravings, and then we worked a little over the Lotto. \nI finished Gebhardt\u2019s Autour d\u2019une Tiare, a book for the children, some day. \n[p26]\n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, March 22, 1894, Florence\nBernhard is reading and enjoying Hegel\u2019s Aesthetics. \nHe took Miss Hallowell for a walk in the afternoon. He said she illustrated to him, without meaning to, the inevitable attitude of the American girl to a young man, which is that of a shepherdess in Theocritus\u2019 idyl who keeps saying to the amorous shepherd, \u201cLittle satyr, what are you up to?\u201d He said he could not discover a girl en flagrant d\u00e9lit de penser about any subject in literature or life. \nShe has had years of training in Greek, but was taught Greek literature rather \u201cas an illustration to Goodwin\u2019s Grammar\u201d, her professor. She has read very little, Scott, Shakspeare, [sic] Thackeray, no French, almost no German. She still has the youthful feeling of always wanting to be first, and desiring everyone to look up to her and think her clever. If she stayed in Europe a while, under wholesome conditions, she \n[p27] \nwould get not that desire perhaps, but the expectation of realizing it knocked out of her! \nI read Laugel\u2019s Oreille et la Musique, and gave Bernhard a music lesson. \nHe began Rosny\u2019s Bilat\u00e9ral, lent me by Vernon Lee.\nLoeser wants to make up old scores, and has invited us to lunch. Giving meals seems a sort of instinctive habit with him, a kind of automatic reaction which occurs when the thought of an acquaintance presents itself to his mind. \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, March 23, 1894\n\u201cGood\u201d (!) Friday\nFinished at the dentist\u2019s!\nWe walked around San Miniato with Miss Hallowell, who told us that the Boston Irish boys made a barricade last winter in a street near one of the suburban railway stations, and fought every boy from Arlington and Medford who came in by the train to attend school. Some of the \n[p28] \nboys were severely hurt. They made it a point of honour not to \u201ccall in the policemen\u201d \u2014 fancy policemen waiting to be \u201ccalled in\u201d in such a case!!\nLoeser came to tea, and was aphasiac and pretentious as usual.\nI read Rosny\u2019s translation and abridgement of the Ram\u00e1yana, and we read Francis Thomson\u2019s poems.\n$$HEADER$$_* Saturday, March 24, 1894, Florence\nWrote article for Alys in the morning. \nBernhard read Hegel, etc. \nIn the afternoon we went with Jenkins to S. Domenico and looked at \u201cvillas to let\u201d on the Fiesole hill. \nIn the evening Bernhard read L\u2019Optique dans l\u2019art (Laugel)and I read Rosny\u2019s Bilat\u00e9ral.\n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, March 25, 1894, Easter \nI was awake early with a horrible pain in my heart at the thought of the nonsense and superstition that was going to be crammed into the defenceless innocent minds of my two little children today. It\u2019s perfectly \n[p29] \noutrageous that law that gives the father the right to determine the children\u2019s religion. Yet perhaps, on a wide view, it makes for civilization, considering that more fathers are atheists than mothers. Alas! \nFabbri spent the afternoon here, looking at Lotto photographs. He judges everything by the Velasquez or Japanese standard, and prefers Botticelli to Bellini. \nBernhard dined at the Palmerino. \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, March 26, 1894, Florence\nWorked at Lotto during the day. \nThe proofs of my article in The Nineteenth Century came.\nWe lunched at Loeser\u2019s with Miss Hallowell, and there made our first real acquaintance with Outamaro and his master. We passed a couple of hours of absolutely lyric joy looking at those things. His collection is very unequal. His rooms are furnished with exquisite taste. He seemed rather nice, and I am glad we have tried to heal up the quarrel. \n[p30]\n$$HEADER$$_* Tuesday, March 27, 1894, Florence\nWorked on the Lotto. \nLoeser called in the evening and was rather nice. \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, March 28, 1894\nLotto still. \nFabbri called and we had a good deal of talk. \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, March 29, 1894\nLotto. \nMet Miss Hallowell at San Marco and afterwards walked in the Boboli Gardens. Miss H. discoursing earnestly if not thrillingly about her Boston and Cambridge \u201ccircle\u201d. \nWe took her to see Ferravilla in the evening, a couple of dull plays. \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, March 30, 1894\nIl Palmerino, Maiano\nLotto. \nFabbri came to make an etching. \nBernhard walked with me here. \n\u201cVernon Lee\u201d talked nonsense about \u201cliterature\u201d all the evening, and I felt rather sick. She denies the possibility of historical ideas, and says that literature has nothing \n[p31] \nto do with fact, i.e., that if Pater had written a Plato founded upon spurious inferior neo-Platonic writings, the book would have had an equal value! which is \u2014 in my opinion \u2014 standing on one\u2019s head.\n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, March 31, 1894, Maiano \nTalked, drove and looked at a villa.\nTalked, met Mr. Benn, read Francis Thompson\u2019s poems with Mr. Hamilton.\nVernon Lee is fearfully down on Bernhard\u2019s book, says it is an inferior kind of a Symonds, for he is quite as far as Symonds from having mastered the whole of the facts he professes to deal with, i.e., the psychology which could produce, let us say, along with the decadent pictures of the \u201cCatholic Reaction\u201d, time the severe and solemn music of \n[p32] \nPalestrina. Like almost all she says, it betrayed a curious insight, almost genius, mingled with a hopeless incapacity for grappling with and consequent scepticism towards facts.\n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, April 1, 1894, Maiano\nAgain walking, talking, driving, talking.\nVernon Lee this morning declared that she thought Berenson \u201cabsolutely insensitive to literature\u201d, she thinks he is nothing but a \u201cScientist\u201d, without a ray of aesthetic appreciation for anything but his own \u201cFach\u201d, and as for that, well, it isn\u2019t worth spending much time on. \nThe Thomson \u2014 such a dear person \u2014 has an irritating way of saying, \u201cDear me! dear me! do you know that\u2019s very fine what you were just saying, Vernon!!\u201d \nDr \n[p33] \nBaldwin called and told two delicious American stories. One was of a baptism in a creek in New England, his father, the Presbyterian minister standing on the bridge looking on half disapprovingly. A crowd was standing about in reverent awe. The Baptist minister came to baptising his own daughter, and as he ducked her under with one hand, he waved the other to his rival on the bridge and shouted, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that in a bowl!\u201d\nAnother Baptist congregation in Ausonia, Connecticut, finding that pneumonia and other diseases followed in the wake of open-air baptisms, set up a so-called \u201cbaptistry\u201d in their church, namely a tank of heatable water under the moveable floor of the platform. The minister was noticed going to the church very early every Sunday morning \n[p34] \nwith a little bundle under his arm. The pious said he went to pray, but as that did not account for the bundle, two preying old maids of his congregation determined to watch him, climbing up to one of the windows they looked in and saw him calmly enjoying a bath, with a good bar of yellow soap!\nAs Dr Baldwin said, he decided, shortly afterwards, to seek another field for the exercise of his peculiar talents. \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, April 2, 1894\n12 Lungarno Acciajuoli, Florence\nA quiet morning wandering among the poderi. \nI came in and found Fabbri and Bernhard here, and after tea took a walk with Bernhard. \nLoeser came in the evening, full of anguish because he had been the means of spreading the cruel slander of Berenson\u2019s dishonesty in money matters \u2014 or rather, full of anguish because it was found out. He promised to repair it, and we \u201cmade up\u201d. \n[p35]\n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, April 3, 1894, Florence \nWe went house-hunting, slightly to the detriment of our tempers, over the Fiesole hill in the morning.\nMiss A. Thomson came to look at photographs of sculpture in the afternoon and Fabbri to tea.\nI called on Miss Hallowell and found her in a rapture of youthful enthusiasm for us both, the enthusiasm having been called out by a letter from her mother warning her to have nothing to do with either of us. She is particularly anxious to go to Lucca with us, because it is a chance to let her parents see that she does mean to \u201clead her own life\u201d. Since she gave up the idea of being a doctor, for which she had succeeded in successfully asserting her independence, they have been hoping she would fall back in the \u201cdaughter at home\u201d again, and her mother has been writing to her to get plenty of nice party dresses, so that they can go out together and be happy as they were four years ago. She thinks Bernhard the cleverest man alive and me the most emancipated and superior woman she has ever met!! \n[p36] \nWe dined at Loeser\u2019s in the evening \u2014 an awfully good dinner, and came away early after looking over some photographs. \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, April 4, 1894, Florence \nWe went house-hunting and found just what we wanted!\nAfter lunch I wrote a full statement of our affairs to Miss Cruttwell, while Carlo Placci took Bernhard to call upon the sculptor Hildebrand.\n Miss Paget told me their story. \nMadame Hildebrand was engaged to be married at 15, but came to the conclusion that she and her fianc\u00e9 were not congenial. However, he over-persuaded her to marry him, but on condition that if she got tired of him she was to leave him, without any unfriendliness. This was actually carried out when she was 18, and she went home to live her mother, taking her baby boy with her.\nSoon after she met Hildebrand, a talented young sculptor, and a great thinker. She went to live with him, but had such a horror of marriage that she did not get her husband to give her a divorce. Year after year, to \n[p37] \nthe amusement of all her friends, the pair produced a daughter, up to the number of about a dozen. Then at last the wished-for son arrived, and no more children have appeared since, for three or four years. Their friends kept urging them to get married, so in the end they did. Their grown-up children coming to the wedding. The old husband, after getting his divorce, also married again. These girls are all being brought up in their mother\u2019s views about marriage. \nBernhard said they looked like young Goths, with long straight locks, crowned with wreaths, and low-cut dresses. The family realizes perfectly the Goethesque idea of \u201cCulture\u201d, the ideal of the \u201cVollverwandtschaften\u201d.\n Madame Hildebrand is the matronly realization of Charlotte, the emblem of maternity, but of free maternity. One of the daughters is painting, but her father will not let her have any lessons. He wants her genius to \n[p38] \ndevelop spontaneously. The result is that the influence of the German pictures they have on their walls is unchecked!\nIn the evening Bernhard read Morelli and Bandello and I read Goldwin Smith\u2019s United States. \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, April 5, 1894, Florence \nEmily Dawson came to see me in the morning, and I showed her Lotto photographs. She said that the one and only enjoyment of most people in Raphael\u2019s Stanze and the Sistine is to verify Baedeker. \nIn the afternoon Bernhard and I took a long walk, meaning to go to the Incontro,\n but actually arriving at a far more romantic spot, the deserted Peruzzi quarries.\nBernhard read Huysmans\u2019 \u00c0 vau-l\u2019eau, and I read Howells\u2019 The World of Chance.\n$$HEADER$$_Friday, April 6, 1894, Florence\nWrote and worked in the morning. \nMiss Hallowell came to lunch and I took her to see the \n[p39] \nBotticelli Dante illustrations, also Santa Maria Novella and the Donatello lion in the Casa Martelli. \nEmily and her friend Miss Rea and Jenkins all came to tea.\nAfterwards Bernhard and I went to San Miniato with Emily <Dawson> and Miss Rea. \nLoeser joined us at dinner at the Antica Luna in order to tell us about his visit to the Gordigianis in their villa. He was naively self-important. He thinks, and it is probably true, that they want him to marry the Gordigiani girl, whom he alludes to as Giulietta. He says, however, that she is in love with Costa. She is a very fine musician, and a constant smoker and hard drinker. \nAfter he had gone, Bernhard read Goldwin Smith and I read <Huysmans\u2019> \u00c0 vau-l\u2019eau. \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, April 7, 1894, Florence\nMorning working, Bernhard over photos, I over charts of painters. \nI called on the Dawsons and Mrs. Keen in the afternoon, and Bernhard walked to the Incontro\n with Mr. Benn.\nRead Laugel and Goldwin Smith in the evening. \n[p40] \n$$HEADER$$_* Sunday, April 8, 1894, Florence\nI wrote my article for Alys and read Daniel Valgraive by Rosny.\nEmily and her friend came to tea with Bernhard and he talked very well. He said the catechism which teaches us that Christians are supposed to have only holy and noble emotions is like a path which is carefully made to look safe and solid, although it is really only a thin covering over a pit through which you fall the moment you actually step on it. \nAfterwards Bernhard and I walked in the poderi behind Bellosguardo. \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, April 9, 1894, Florence\nFinished the article for Alys, lunched with the Dawsons. \nRead Pasolini\u2019s Caterina Sforza.\n \nBernhard called on the Forbes. He said they could not believe that Fafnir had never heard of the Annunciation, and when he told them that Fafnir had had serious thoughts of becoming a parson, they began to doubt the sanity of the narrator! \nMr. Obrist called to ask us to go to see his fountain. \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, April 10, 1894, Florence \nWe went at 9 to see Obrist\u2019s fountain, and it gave us a thrill of delighted surprise. As we walked along, we kept saying, \u201cWhy are we going? We know it will be bad!\u201d and \n[p41]\nlo! it was delightful, a fairy dream, executed in marble with such fine tact and delicacy and originality that it made us happy for the rest of the day. \nObrist spoke so picturesquely of his own mind as if it were a block of marble, and said he had chipped a chiselled and polished away every trace of academic tradition. And indeed his work was original. You saw the compatriot of B\u00f6cklin, but a man with a more delicate fancy, better taste, and more feeling for his art as art. The relief was a perfect illustration of all that Bernhard has been preaching about relief for the last month! \nEnthusiastic letters about The Venetian Painters keep coming in. Today a lady talked of translating it into French!! \nMr. Fisher called on Bernhard, and I met them at lunch. \nBernhard took Miss A. Thomson to the Medici Tombs and the Masaccios, and I took Fisher to the Uffizi.\nWe three then met here, and had a really delightful talk about scientific history, and then Bernhard took him to call on Mr. Benn.\nIn the evening Emily and Miss Rea and Loeser dined with us, and then came here and talked until eleven and very pleasantly. Emily is really charming. \n[p42] \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, April 11, 1894, Florence \nWe spent the day with Loeser and Miss Hallowell walking to the Incontro. We took our lunch and Santayana\u2019s just-published poems. The lunch was very good, but the poems very bad. \nMiss Hallowell dined with Bernhard and me at the Luna.\n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, April 12, 1894 \nI took Emily and Miss Rea to see a Villa in the morning.\nBernhard took the Mallets to the Uffizi, and then we dined with Emily, Miss Rea, and Fabbri at Loeser\u2019s. Loeser was as full of baleverines as usual. He said that the \u201cvalues\u201d in Puvis\u2019 portrait of himself are all wrong. \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, April 13, 1894\nIl Palmerino, Maiano \nBernhard and I called on Obrist and found a charming bust called \u201cA Faun Listening\u201d. \nWe met Emily and Miss Rea in the Medici Tombs, and then had tea together. \nAfterwards Bernhard and I walked here. \nI read Mrs. Ward\u2019s horribly trashy tale Marcella.\n[p43] \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, April 14, 1894, Maiano\nDrove in for my trunk, which was left by mistake, and letters, and caught a glimpse of Bernhard, who said he had dined with Loeser. \nRead Vernon Lee\u2019s Countess of Albany and Hauntings, and her brother\u2019s poems, which someone compared to a mixture of Shakspeare [sic] and Gilbert! \nRead aloud a good deal to Mr. Hamilton, who says that now that he is getting better, he doesn\u2019t think writing poetry is worthwhile. \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, April 15, 1894, Maiano \nRead a good deal of Anna Karenina\n to Mr. Hamilton and the rest (the part about Anna and Wronsky) to myself. What a tremendous story! \nI read also Vernon Lee\u2019s Ottilie, Prince of the 100 Soups and a dozen articles of hers, and Mary Robinson\u2019s Margaret of Navarre, also Henry James\u2019 Private Life and Macaulay\u2019s essay on Ranke\u2019s Popes. \n[p44] \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, April 16, 1894, Florence \nRead to Mr. Hamilton, came home after lunch. \nLoeser, Miss Hallowell and Bernhard came to tea, and we planned out our trip. \nMr. Obrist came later and dined with us. He described a man as in a \u201cLiebig\u2019s Extract of Rage\u201d, and said the Germans trying to improve and culture themselves were as ridiculous and naive as ducks cleaning themselves.\nRain has come at last. \n$$HEADER$$_* Tuesday, April 17, 1894, Florence\nI took Emily and her friend to the Pitti. \nWe lunched with Loeser and came home and worked.\n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, April 18, 1894 \nBernhard took a \u201cclass\u201d (Mr. Mallet, Mrs. Scott, etc.) to the Pitti, and worked. \nI took Emily and Miss Rea to Prato, and we walked across from Poggio a Caiano to Signa.\nI read Morelli on the Munich Gallery.\n$$HEADER$$_+ Thursday, April 19, 1894, Florence\nA starred day for it has been so lovely! \nTwo nice reviews of Bernhard\u2019s Venetian \n[p45] \nPainters, one in The Scottish Leader (written by Robertson), and the other in the National Observer, came this morning. \nBernhard finished the Bonsignori section of his Lotto, and I worked on a Botticelli article. \nAfter lunch we took the steam tram for Signa, and then had a magical walk over to Montelupo,\n through pines and banks of white heather with a windy cloudy sky and bright bursts of sunshine. Such romance, and wildness, and beauty!\nWe missed the train to Florence (6.18), so drove to Signa (3 fr. 50 mancia) where we missed the tram. But we had an excellent dinner at the caff\u00e9 and a moonlight stroll, and then caught the 10 o\u2019clock train home. We were very happy and enjoyed each other and the walk to the utmost. \n[p46] \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, April 20, 1894, Florence \nWrote in the morning. Bernhard about Montagna, I about Botticelli. \nAfter lunch Bernhard went to meet Prof. Everett of Harvard at Loeser\u2019s and then took a walk with Loeser, and I called on Mr. Hamilton. He had never read a word of Matthew Arnold, and I recited him a good deal, and we fell to talking about poetry, and its attitude to life. He said he had been thinking a great deal about the folly of saying over again in rhyme all the old things that have already been so well said, but he feared that the interpretation of life from the new point of view (science and progress) would not be poetical. \nIn the evening we read Nordau\u2019s D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rescence, and talked of it. \n$$HEADER$$_* Saturday, April 21, 1894, Florence\nWrote in the morning. \nMiss Hallowell took Bernhard to Miss Alexander\u2019s (Wayside Songs in Tuscany)\n to see a reputed Lotto, which \n[p47] \nturned out to be a XIV century daub! They went then to the Bargello. \nI read Nordau. \nThey came to tea and we talked a good deal. Miss Hallowell says everyone who studies Greek at Harvard hates it! She had never heard of Perry\u2019s book. \nI went with her to choose some photos and Bernhard called on Mr. Benn, who was full of the National Observer review, which compares Bernhard\u2019s compression of Venetian art into such a small book to the famous lines: \nLittle Johnny:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pair of skates\nHole in Ice:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Golden Gates.\nIn the evening I read Pasolini\u2019s Caterina Sforza\n and Bernhard read Leslie Stephen\u2019s essays. \n$$HEADER$$_x Sunday, April 22, 1894, Florence\nI met Miss Boord, and she came in to see me. She was evidently awfully glad to meet me again, and said with glee that her mother was ill. Evidently the old toad keeps her in utter subjection, and the girl \n[p48] \nresents it and hates her mother in consequence. She related to me with glee that her mother liked Carlo Dolce.\n How idiotic mothers often are. What they must surely want is the love and confidence of their daughters, and they do everything to kill the one and make the other impossible!\nBernhard wrote some notes for The Nation in the afternoon and we read and took a little walk. \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, April 23, 1894, Florence\nStill raining. We enjoyed working in the morning. \nLoeser and Obrist came to tea, and Mr. Obrist decided to come on our trip with us. He is a fascinating person. \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, April 24, 1894\nLeon d\u2019Oro, Cesena\nWe started at 7.10 and reached Faenza at 12.35. \nI read a good deal of Rosny\u2019s Nell Horn\n on the way. \nAt Faenza we enjoyed the Donatellos. I was especially glad to find that I appreciated the \n[p49] \nSt Jerome, which repelled me a year and a half ago. In other words, my eye was not then educated, as it is now, to appreciate structure and composition. \nWe almost came to blows in the Cathedral over the architecture, which Loeser declared was unmitigatedly bad, and in which Bernhard and I saw a very fine idea. But the storm blew over, and we had our dinner in peace and came on here to what seems a clean, comfortable enough hotel. \nThe We = Bernhard and myself, Miss Hallowell, Loeser and Obrist.\n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, April 25, 1894\n<Albergo> Zongo, Pesaro \nWe saw the Pinacoteca and Library, and then walked up to the Madonna del Monte outside of which we sat for a long time on the grass, discussing Peer Ghynt, Baumeister Solness, etc. \nAfter lunch \n[p50] \nbefore the train, I finished Nell Horn, a book which moved me to tears, which Bernhard had the bad taste to keep making fun of and recurring to again and again, until I really lost my temper. It is an awfully ordinary history, but told with such truth to detail that even though he does not succeed in creating anything very astonishing in the way of character, you can\u2019t help realizing how much of that sort of thing is going on actually, at the present moment, and it grips your head. After all, with me I suppose it is partly a question of that little daughter. \nWe saw Rimini and came on by evening to Pesaro. \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, April 26, 1894, Italia, Urbino\nSaw the Bellinis. \nObrist and I had a little drive together by the sea, and \u201ca pleasant walk and a pleasant talk upon the briny beach\u201d.\nThen we all drove here, an enchanting drive, enlivened by \n[p51] \nthe most brilliant conversations between Bernhard and Obrist \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, April 27, 1894, Italia, Urbino \nSaw the ducal palace, etc., and enjoyed it hugely.\nAfter lunch Loeser and Bernhard went on to look at other things. \nMiss Hallowell took the American girls\u2019 nap, and Obrist and I sat on the grass under the town wall and discussed \u201cthe woman question\u201d, upon which, so it seems, we were nearly agreed, but who can fathom the bas fond of a man\u2019s mind? Certainly not a young woman acquaintance! He is for a three years marriage system, and the children to belong entirely to the mother, with a minimum state allowance for the maintenance and education of every child. \nIn the evening we tried to make Obrist enjoy English poetry. He read \n[p52] \nit aloud, and Bernhard expounded it so brilliantly, so sympathetically that Miss Hallowell and I were perfectly overwhelmed! \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, April 28, 1894, Sant\u2019Angelo\nO what a splendid day! \nWe drove in the morning to a little place called Pian di Meleto, and after lunch Loeser and Bernhard and I, led by a guide, walked to Montefiorentino to see an early Alvise. It was a tough, long walk, but I enjoyed it. The frati gave us some refreshment at the top, or we should have fainted. \nWe drove on here in the twilight and had such an awful dinner that, as Loeser said, in London even the elephants at the Zoo would have refused it.\n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, April 29, 1894, Cagli \nWe spent the day driving here, a splendid day, full of inconceivably brilliant talk between the two protagonists, \n[p53] \nBernhard and Obrist, and of delighted appreciation on the part of the rest of us. \nWalked out in the evening and saw the old Roman bridge.\n$$HEADER$$_Monday, April 30, 1894, Giardino, Gubbio\nDrove here, stopping by the way to pay a call on a mad Englishman\n who lives in a villa at Cantiano\n with a French actress (his wife) and some pretty children. \nIt began to pour, but we \u201cdid\u201d Gubbio.\n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, May 1, 1894, Florence\nBack again. \nThe rain drove three of us home, but Loeser and Miss Hallowell stayed on at Perugia. \nWe lunched at Foligno, and arrived here about 9.\n$$HEADER$$_* Wednesday, May 2, 1894, Florence\nRegular life begins again. \nWe were cheered up by hearing from Mr. Davis that Putnam said the Venetian \n[p54] \nbottom of p. 49-50 torn away\nPainters had been well received and was a success. \nWe took a wonderful walk behind Bellosguardo towards sunset. \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, May 3, 1894, Florence [crossed out]\n$$HEADER$$_Friday, June 1, 1894, Florence\nNearly a month\u2019s interval. \nWe have been living very quietly, I seeing practically nobody but Obrist (Bernhard of course), but him every day, while Bernhard has been going out more than his wont under the wing of Carlo Placci and meeting charming people like the Countess Rasponi, the Baroness French, Signor Nencioni, Prince Galitzina, etc. He has enjoyed it. \n[p55] \nBernhard has spent all his spare time over his Lotto, which is being completely re-written, and is \u201cswellin\u2019 visibly under our merry eyes\u201d.\nTo take up the tale, from day to day. \nWe worked in the morning, Bernhard writing on Lotto\u2019s Bergamask period, and I type-writing the part about 1512-1517. \nIn the afternoon\n[p56] \nI went up to see my Fiesolan Villa, and afterwards joined him at Fiesole where we dined.\nWe walked down together and had a beer at Gilli and Letta\u2019s. \nHe has made me resolve to learn German.\n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, June 2, 1894, Florence\nAnother blank! \n[p57] \n$$HEADER$$_* Thursday, June 14, 1894\nAlbergo del Nord, Milan\nBernhard and I left Florence today, the Lotto still unfinished. \nObrist spent the day with me, up to our starting. He is himself going to Munich in a few days. \nI read L\u2019education sentimentale  and enjoyed it very much, in site of the contradiction between the story-teller and the describer. All those minute descriptions made it seem like an old, old novel, from another time, but the talk, the life, was curiously up to date. \nBernhard read La vita italiana nel Cinquecento.\n$$HEADER$$_Friday, June 15, 1894, Milan\nSaw the Bagatti Valsecchi and Bonomi-Cereda pictures, also Frizzoni and his sister. \nSaw Libro Resta at Ambrosiana. \n[p58] \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, June 16, 1894\nItalia, Milano; Concordia, Bergamo \nBrera, Archbishop\u2019s Palace, etc. \nCame here and hunted everywhere for rooms away from church bells, but found nothing.\nBernhard called on the Piccinelli\u2019s and they said that the Bergamasks delight in bells and spend all the money of the tiniest villages getting new ones, which they escort in triumph with garlands and songs. \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, June 17, 1894, Zogno\n\n(Hotel in furthest piazza, rooms one franc.)\nDrove here along the Val Brembana, and after lunch drove on to Serina\n to see a ruined Palma.\nA lovely quiet inn. \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, June 18, 1894, Bergamo \nA terrible climb to Peghera (walking would be better), which is one of the most beautiful mountain valleys I ever saw. No albergo, but we got some eggs, which we cooked ourselves. \nThe \n[p59] \nschool mistress, a pretty Bergamask young woman of 22, came in to chat with us. Her salary is 600 francs a year, and two rooms. She was clever and evidently a free-thinker. Out of her own head she had organized a course in history for her pupils, beginning with \u201948 and ending with the unity of Italy. She said that superstitions still reigned, among the women and children, and that in Peghera alone, a miserable, tiny little place, with nothing but a foot-path leading to it, there were four witches.\nShe told us about the parocco who had just been sent away, on account of a young woman. Poor parocco, he was only 29 years old, and very \u201cliberal\u201d. She liked him and got on well with him at the school. The young woman was married to the priest\u2019s father. \n[p60] \nThe Palma we went to see was not much but the driver and the whole experience was delightful. \n$$HEADER$$_ Tuesday, June 19, 1894\ntrain for B\u00e2le \n\nWe spent the day in Bergamo and saw the gallery, etc., including the Frizzoni-Salis pictures.\n Called on the Piccinellis. \nDined at Cova\u2019s in Milan, in the garden.\nTook a sleeping-powder. \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, June 20, 1894\nMiss Austin\u2019s Pension, Universit\u00e4tstrasse, Strassburg \nMissed the first train at B\u00e2le, but reached here soon after one. \nFafnir was waiting for us, and we spent the rest of the day talking, walking and eating. \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, June 21, 1894, Strassburg\n\nLoafed with Fafnir. \nThe cathedral is a great disappointment. I remembered the choir and transepts as something extraordinarily impressive and mysterious, but that awkward window in the middle of the choir-apse, is such a bad piece of \n[p61]\n lighting, that it completely destroys the effect from the nave. From the transept the effect is better, particularly when you peer up into that dark cupola. \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, June 22, 1894, Strassburg\nA nice day of loafing and talking. \nWe looked at the pictures, and enjoyed the Carianis and Theotocopuli and I discovered a Francesco Cotignola. \nWandered about the \u201cKleine Frankreich\u201d, but decided that we no longer care for the dirty and squalid picturesque. \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, June 23, 1894, Strassburg\nI saw the cathedral again, from the clock transept, and were very much impressed by it. The lighting was very fine, with the door open, bringing out the great column in full relief \n[p62] \nagainst the gloom of the cupola. \nWe discussed Manon Lescaut a good deal, and found it peculiarly wonderful because it was the first psychological presentation of a woman who could love and yet be \u201cunfaithful\u201d, regarding her body as a thing apart.\nFafnir has the faculty of drawing B.B. out in a delightful way. \nI am reading D\u2019Annunzio\u2019s Trionfo della Morte, and B.B. Nell Horn. \n\n[p63] \nWhy have I not written all this time? Chi lo sa? I grow lazy in my old age.\nWe went from Strassburg to Paris, where we saw the two Salons. One reason for my not writing was, I suppose, that I sent such full notes of the pictures and sculpture to Obrist. \nWe saw a good deal of M. Reinach, and B.B. went to spend a day with his friends the Perrys, who half converted him to a belief in the \u201cnext world\u201d, through their account of Mrs. Piper\u2019s wonderful revelations! \n[p64] \nAs Burke said (Burke also came to Paris to be with us), his mind is \u201cTo Let\u201d on all such subjects. \nThen we went to London, and stayed until the 24th of August, I at Haslemere most of the time. We saw the Ferrarese exhibition together, and Woburn Abbey. The children were delightful, and Bernhard enjoyed his old and new English friends, and moreover, earned \u00a3233 by recommending pictures. \nI had an article in the Chronicle, a review of Scott\u2019s Old Florence, and the Studio took the review of Ulmann\u2019s Botticelli.\nBernhard, as usual, had a lot of notes in The Nation. \nI began seriously to study German. \n[p65] \n$$HEADER$$_x Friday, August 24, 1894\nHotel de France, Lille \nWe left London at 11 this morning, reaching here about 5.\nOn the way we quarrelled, but completely made it up \u2014 and forever, I hope! It is \u201cobvious to the meanest intelligence\u201d that we can\u2019t get along without each other, so why should we quarrel?\n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, August 25, 1894, Lille\nSaw the gallery, and found, of course, some Beccaruzzis and Polidoros.\n Unfortunately many of the drawings were invisible, as the collection is just being installed in a new building, and the \u201cdirector had gone away with the key\u201d \u2014 our usual luck! \nHowever, the Lille bust made up, more than made up for the \n[p66] \njourney. What a beauty! It is clearly Florentine, end of XV or beginning of XVI century, but is it Leonardo? It is modelled like Leonardo, but the type is strangely Raphaelesque and so is the composition. Altogether it is the loveliest modern thing I have ever seen. (I put in \u201cmodern\u201d, for I remember that wonderful little ivory Madonna from the XII century, in the Bargello).\nBernhard is reading Nietzsche and I V\u00e2ter und S\u00f6hne by Tourgenieff. \n$$HEADER$$_* Sunday, August 26, 1894\nCerf et Commerce, Douai\nAfter a long look at the bust, we came here, and have faithfully \u201cdone\u201d the town, with nothing to reward us except a B. Veneto. \n[p67]\n$$HEADER$$_Monday, August 27, 1894, \n* Hotel d\u2019Angleterre, Beauvais \nRevisited Amiens, and found some Italian things, Guardi, Tiepolo, etc. The Puvis did not look as they once did, although we still liked them. \nThen we came to this enchanting quiet town, which we have greatly enjoyed. The cathedral is fine and the place is full of interesting things. It is almost Italian, with its large open square, the old forum, and many churches, and the moat and avenue outside. \n$$HEADER$$_x Tuesday, August 28, 1894\nCorneille, Paris \nCame here and spent the afternoon in the Luxembourg and Sainte Chapelle, \n[p68] \nending up with a drive in the Bois. We enjoyed Rodin\u2019s bust in the Luxembourg, and fought over the polychrome colouring of the Sainte Chapelle, Bernhard defending it. \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, August 29, 1894\nCorneille, Paris\nHad a fine gallop round the Louvre in the morning, and an hour or so in the Cast Collection in the Trocadero in the afternoon. \nI was unwell and came home, while Bernhard haunted the bookstalls of the Od\u00e9on. \nHe bought the new Maeterlinck, and we read Alladine e Pallamides in the Luxembourg, and fought over it, Bernhard defending it. He grows too tolerant!!\n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, August 30, 1894\nCorneille, Paris\nWe spent some enchanted hours in \n[p69] \nin Notre Dame, which we liked more than ever before. Bernhard has become less academic, with age, and can forgive the architectural contradiction of the two stories resting on the columns, as they do. The choir is superb, and I know nothing anywhere to set beside the fa\u00e7ade.\nThen we went to the H\u00f4tel de Ville and saw the new hall decorated by Puvis de Chavannes, which was very pretty. \nAfter lunch we went to the Exposition du Livre, and saw some nice Japanese things. Bernhard also ordered a perfect desk for himself.\nBut best of all, we looked at the exhibition of Cl\u00e9ment Massier\u2019s pottery, more \n[p70] \nwonderful, more beautiful than anything there. How covetous we felt!\nThen we had a drive in the Bois. Alas! for our parting tomorrow. \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, August 31, 1894\nI left Paris at 8.20, and Bernhard was to leave for Havre at one o\u2019clock. We tried not to be sentimental, but it is a great wrench, that horrible ocean!\n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, September 1, 1894\nWeisser Hirsch bei Dresden \nA nice Harvard boy in \u201cmy\u201d train, came over to study \u201cthe literature of the Romance nations\u201d in a year. He was a mixture of Fafnir and Norman. We \u2026 \n[p73] \nYes, it is clear if I wish to be a thinking being I must metaphysicize.\nObrist left Sept. 7. \nChristina Bremner arrived on the 8th and we had a week in Dresden, a day in the Spreewald, 4 days in Berlin, and 8 in Holland. I enjoyed Franz Hals to the full. \nThen home until Nov.

Berty and B.B. made friends, I hope. \nJonathan Sturges came to call in the afternoon. \nI saw Berty off for England by the 9 o\u2019clock train.\n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, December 1, 1894\n3 rue de Beaune, Paris \nMoved over here to cheaper quarters, B.B. at the Hotel Voltaire.\n Spent a really rapturous morning in the Louvre.\n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, December 2, 1894, Paris \nNotre Dame and the Russian Church in the morning, and this concert in the afternoon. A lyric day. The weather is marvellous. \n[p75] \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, December 3, 1894, Paris\nCalled on Reinach, who was very nice. Went with him and M. Dreyfus to the Louvre, and were nearly bored to death by \u201cshop\u201d talk about the outsides of pictures. \nCalled on Ephrussi of the Gazette des Beaux Arts, and came back absolutely \u201cin a state of complete prostitution\u201d, as the lady said, from the ennui of associating in such a way with such people! M. Reinach knew, of American writers, Poe, Hawthorne and Mark Twain. \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, December 4, 1894, Paris\nMet Loeser in the Louvre and lunched with him. \nWent to call on Anquetin, a Normandy painter of 33 who seems like a reincarnation of Michelangelo. His work is very strong. We all liked him too. \n\n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, December 5, 1894, Paris\nSent off some of my Hampton Court Guides, and went to M. Dreyfus at 1 and saw the Sciarra and Goldschmidt pictures. \n[p76] \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, December 6, 1894\n3 rue de Beaune, Paris \nMet Loeser in the Louvre drawings. Saw Dreyfus\u2019 things. \nLoeser dined here and we went to the Chat Noir to see it and Fragerolle\u2019s things, which are after all prettier in books. \nFelt horribly respectable and out of it. Too serious. \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, December 7, 1894\nB.B. took Miss Anstruther Thomson to the Louvre, and I paid a nice call upon M. Reinach. \nLunched with Loeser at the Boeuf \u00e0 la Mode \u2014 ate too much. \nBernhard dined with the Toys. \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, December 8, 1894\nB.B. took the Bywaters to the Luxembourg. \nI read Michelet at the Biblioth\u00e8que Centrale, and was awfully amused at his criticism of Michelangelo.\nSturges came to tea, and he and Loeser stayed to dinner and til 1, chatting, while B.B. went to dine with the Perrys. \nLoeser told of Royce\u2019s little boy who was taught nothing about religion or death. One day \n[p77] \nhe said one of little friends had \u201cstopped\u201d. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cWhy just stopped, you know.\u201d It was his description of death.\n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, December 9, 1894\nMet Reinach in <the> Louvre and looked at drawings in the Salle des Boites, then lunched with him, meeting his wife, an ex-medical student. \nThen we went to this concert and afterwards Loeser and Sturges came to dine and spend the evening. \n[p78]\n$$HEADER$$_ Monday, December 10, 1894\n3 rue de Beaune, Paris \nWent with Reinach to the Luxembourg, and went all over with him and M. B\u00e9n\u00e9dite. \nGot awfully tired, for they made us look at all the bad pictures and statuary. \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, December 11, 1894\nWorked on Louvre drawings, went to Durand-Ruel\u2019s after lunch. \nMrs. Hapgood called. \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, December 12, 1894\nCalled on Reinach, went with him.\n Sturges came for the evening.\n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, December 13, 1894 \nAlys\u2019 wedding day!

Chennevi\u00e8re\u2019s room upstairs, the Bellini sketch-book, and the Codex Vallardi. \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, December 14, 1894 \nBernhard called on Mrs. Perry and saw some Pissaro water-colour sketches. I called on Reinach and he met me there.\nWe lunched with Loeser and went to see the Rouart\n collection (34 rue de Lisbonne) of Degas, Manet, Corot and above all Daumier. \nAwfully tired!\n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, December 15, 1894\nDrawings in portfolios in Louvre. \nBernhard lunched with Bing and saw his marvellous Japanese things, while I took Mrs. Hapgood to Durand-Ruel\u2019s and the Louvre. \nWe spent the evening with the Reinachs.\n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, December 16, 1894 \nStrange letter from HO. \nBernhard saw Duret\u2019s and Camondo\u2019s pictures. \nWe heard Berlioz\u2019 Requiem at the Colonne and worked in the evening. \n[p82]\n$$HEADER$$_Monday, December 17, 1894\n3 rue de Beaune, Paris\nWent to see M. Ravaisson (11 Quai Voltaire) in the morning. Among a mass of so-called Raphaels, Leonardos, Correggios, Titians and so on, we found a small Balducci, a little Giulio Campi and a Lorenzo di Pavia. But Ravaisson was a dear, naif, old man.\nAfter lunch we went with M. Reinach and M. Mocatta to see some manuscripts in the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale, especially the Heures of Anne de Bretagne.\nThen we went to the gem and antique collection, and afterwards had tea with Reinach and stayed talking. \nBernhard dined with the Boals, and I read Marcel Reymond on Donatello. \nHO wrote that his little servant Marthe had hung herself \u2014 he found her dead in her room! \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, December 18, 1894 \nBernhard went with Mrs. Jack Gardner to the Louvre in the morning, lunched with her, and worked all afternoon and evening on his review of Botticelli (Ulmann) for the Revue critique.\n \nAfter coming home from a most pleasant call upon Anquetin,\n \n[p83] \nwhom I found quite alone, I helped work on the review. We quarrelled, as we usually do when we work together, but made it up out of good sense.\n(Letters from Evelyn X.)\n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, December 19, 1894 \nCalled on Reinach, worked over Botticelli, had nice talks. \nWent to see Sarah Bernhardt in Gismonda. \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, December 20, 1894 \nTook Mme Reinach to the Louvre. There is a fearful tragedy there, the worst of all, the tragedy of being loved. She is dying of ennui. She thinks he enjoys nothing, but the real truth is, his enjoyment is his active brain with information , \u201cjob lots\u201d, as Bernhard said, in traditional Jew fashion!\nWe lunched with Loeser and then B.B. went to call on M. Dreyfus.\nLoeser and Sturges came to dinner and we went to see M. Rouart\u2019s Japanese things, next door to Reinach.\n\nAt 9.30 B.B. and I went in to Reinach, and had a lot of hopping talk. \nMme Reinach came in and told me she did not enjoy a single thing she did. \n[p84] \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, December 22, 1894, London \nI was ill, but we did some errands, getting desks, among other things, and met Loeser at lunch. \nHe and B.B. went to the Luxembourg and I packed. I crossed on Friday night, and had a horrible crossing. \n\n.   .   .\n.\n.\n\nOn Jan. 10, 1895, Mary met Bernhard and Obrist in London and the three travelled together to Reims, where they stayed until Jan. 14, when Obrist went to Paris and Bernhard and Mary left for Basle.\n\n$$HEADER$$_Friday, January 11, 1895\nLion d\u2019Or, Reims\nA strange Christmas tide, now happily over. I will not write of it at present, for all is well again, and I mean it to continue so. \nI left the children listening to the \u201cMysterious Island\u201d. They kissed me goodbye under the impression that I was an octopus, I believe, or else an ourang-outang or a pirate. \nEvelyn came to see me off, and there met Bernhard and Obrist.\n We three came together, talking all the way approximating a quantitative \n[p85] \ndefinition of genius, the power to react against habits. \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, January 12, 1895, Reims\nThe Cathedral! Impossible to express the overwhelming impression of that interior. \nDuring all the day a continuous flow of interesting talk, on hundreds of subjects, but centering generally about some aesthetic or critical question, or the position and future, or real nature of women. \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, January 13, 1895, Reims\nWe have stayed on to get a full impression of the Cathedral, and to enjoy HO, who is himself simply overwhelmed with the architecture and sculpture. We all get on very well together. \nSaw the f\u00eate of S. Remi at the Church of S. Remi \n[p86] \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, January 14, 1895\nLion d\u2019Or, Reims\nStill here, and still happy. We have enjoyed the Cathedral au fond, and each other very much.\n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, January 15, 1895\nVictoria, B\u00e2le\nBernhard and I left at 7.0 in the morning, and HO was going to Paris in the 7.12 train.\nWe came here, reading La fin du Paganisme (Boissier) and James\u2019 Psychology.\n\nArriving here, we found the line broken by an avalanche, and so have to stay over. \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, January 16, 1895, B\u00e2le\nWent to the museum and saw the B\u00f6cklins. There are 3 large frescoes on the staircase, which are really dreadful. Not only without drawing, but really without \n[p87] \nInhalt. Then, upstairs, there is a sculptural head of Medusa, a portrait of a woman, grey and green and brass-yellow, a centaur battle, an allegory of life, glaring in colour, a dead Christ, a mermaid-play, a perfectly banal, vulgar portrait of himself, an (early) Diane \u00e0 la chasse, and a scene in a wood at autumn where a procession of white-robed figures is coming to worship at a flaming altar, by a pool. \nThe only one of these that really moved me was the last, although there are humorous episodes in the mermaids, even so much life and energy in the centaurs, undeniable poetry in the life allegory, and interesting tone in the woman. But this picture was like a note struck that sets marvellous \n[p88] \nover-tones vibrating in one\u2019s nature, a hint of one feeling about the Greeks, such as Browning has in his Pheidippide<s>\n or Arnold in the \u201cNot here, O Apollo\u201d.\n No one else has done this in painting, but the pity of it is, B\u00f6cklin, as a painter, is not at all equal to B\u00f6cklin as a poet. His idea transcends his execution to a really painful degree. \nWe saw a Dead Christ by Holbein which was exquisite in tone, and almost like a Crivelli in drawing, besides being poetical \u2014 almost sublime \u2014 in interpretation.\nWe went also to the Cathedral, and after lunch came back to read and write \u2014 the line not being mended yet. \n[p89]\n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, January 17, 1895, B\u00e2le\nLine not mended. \nBernhard spent most of the day writing a review of Mrs. Ady\u2019s Raphael, which I copied and sent to the Courrier des Arts and the Chronicle. \nAlso I entered into note-books the pictures exhibited at the London Venetian Exhibition. \nWe quarrelled about Barye\u2019s landscapes, and passed on from that to many other subjects of dispute. \nI made up my mind to tell him the whole Obrist story \u2014 when we are once settled in Florence. \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, January 18, 1895\nConcordia, Milan\nAll day in the train. \nRead Boissier\u2019s Fin du Paganism.\n[p90] \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, January 19, 1895, Milan \nWent to Frizzoni\u2019s, the Brera, the Poldi, Crespi\u2019s, and Cavenaghi\u2019s. \nDined at Cova\u2019s and discussed the difference between photographs and art. \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, January 20, 1895\nMilano, Florence \nCame down here. \nEmily Dawson met us at dinner a Villa Kraus & Villa Rosa, Fiesole, 1895-1897\n$$HEADER$$_Monday, January 21, 1895\nVilla Rosa, Fiesole \nMaud Cruttwell came in and we shopped. I bought Bernhard\u2019s house-linen with Emily. \nWe came here and found the housekeeping simply in perfect order. Maud is a brick! \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, January 22, 1895, Fiesole \nUnpacking. \nEmily came up to lunch, and we chatted and unpacked and caused desolation in Bernhard\u2019s room by trying experiments with his wall-paper. The man \n[p91] \nwho carried in his things was frightened by the house dog who barked. \u201cSuo cane\u201d, he said, \u201cha una voce di poeta\u201d, he said. \nWe have a marvellous cook. After an excellent dinner, we read poetry and I worked on the review of Bernhard\u2019s Lotto which the editor of the Gazette des Beaux Arts has asked me for.\n \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, January 23, 1895 \nWorked on the Lotto. \nAfter lunch B and I went to town and desolated ourselves trying to think what to do with his room.\nThen I called on Emily, and she suggested sacking for his walls, to which I added a dad of matting, green and buff. \nI called at the Palmerino and had some talk with Vernon and Miss Thomson about Mr. Hamilton, whom also I saw. \nEnglish poetry in the evening. \n[p92]\n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, January 24, 1895 \nWorked on Lotto, while Bernhard went down to Florence to shop. He drove up with Emily, who came to lunch. \nAfterwards we all looked at Duccio and Giotto photographs.\nBernhard\u2019s room looks lovely!\nIn the evening we read Keats, and other things. \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, January 25, 1895 \nWriting on Lotto in the morning. \nBernhard began his article on the Venetian Exhibition in London.\n \nI went down to the Uffizi in the afternoon, and met Mr. Cook, who was connoisseuring around.\nPoetry in the evening, Chaucer.\n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, January 26, 1895 \nStill settling in. \nBernhard lunched with the Benns and went to the Uffizi with Cook. \nWe read Browning etc., in the evening.\nHe said Furtw\u00e4ngler was like a fox hunter, who scoured the country and beat the ___ and drove the fox into his hole \u2014 and then left him there. \n[p93]\n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, January 27, 1895\nLotto. \nCook came to lunch, and we had an all-day gorge on connoisseuring. He stayed to dinner. Although a Balliol man, he had never heard of Pater, and never read a word of Browning. \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, January 28, 1895\nLotto.\nMr. Hamilton came to lunch. He has cured himself of his auto-suggested illness, which kept him on his back for 20 years. He thought he would be so happy, would wake up to life with the nerves of a boy. But he wakes up with the nerves of a man over 50, and finds nothing makes him happy. Like Mr. Bennett, he asks, \u201cIs this the party?\u201d\nWalked, worked, and read Elizabethan lyrics in the evening, but most of them proved very dull to all three of us. \n[p94] \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, January 29, 1895 \nLotto. \nFabbri came to lunch and was nice and serious and unstimulating as usual. \nWalked with Bernhard, but as we each wanted to go a different way, we separated, instead of squabbling. How sensible! How next century, almost!!\nIn the evening we read Walt Whitman and Browning. \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, January 30, 1895 \nI writing\n Lotto, Bernhard the XV pictures at the New Gallery in the morning. \nIn the afternoon we went with Cook, Maud and Emily to the Uffizi.\nRead Milton in the evening. \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, January 31, 1895 \nWriting.\nEmily to lunch and a lecture from B.B. on the time from Giotto to Masaccio.\nMilton in the evening. I began the French Anthology.\n \n[p95] \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, February 1, 1895\nWriting again.\nStudied Alvise photographs. \nPoetry in evening. \nMichael wrote an angry letter bidding us \u201csail out of her life as if we had never been. Bon voyage, illusion perdue!\u201d \u2014 \u00e0 propos of a misunderstanding. What a lack of psychology, proving her completely of the old generation. Of course it means next to nothing. People who mean those things don\u2019t write them, as Heine says.\n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, February 2, 1895\nAgain grinding away at my writing. \nSnow! snow! snow! and horrible cold.\nLooked at Buonsignori and Cima photos.\nRead Frere\u2019s translation of Aristophanes\u2019 Birds. \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, February 3, 1895\nWriting.\nCook came to lunch, and we connoshered until 5. \nWrote again and again read the Birds. \n[p96] \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, February 4, 1895, Fiesole\nSnow and wind.\nWe carried on our quiet life, work, walked and read, and finished the Birds in the evening. \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, February 5, 1895\nEmily came up to lunch, and we had a lecture on Masolino and Masaccio with photographs. \nWe read Wordsworth at night, also the Bab Ballads.\n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, February 6, 1895\nSent off my review of Lotto to the Gazette des Beaux Arts. \nBegan the one for The Studio.\nRead Shelley, Adonis, and found it pretty poor.\n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, February 7, 1895\nSent off review to <The> Studio. \nArranged papers. Walked. \nRead Scholar Gypsy, Thyrsis, Lycidas and Moschus\u2019 Lament for Bion.\nFeeling rather low about money. \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, February 8, 1895\nMade notes for Bernhard\u2019s review of Lafenestre\u2019s Florence, and studied Catena with him. \nDiscussed the mysterious school of \n[p97] \nGentile Bellini, that still unknown factor in Venetian art. Bernhard wants to revive it, as he has done with Alvise Vivarini.\nLong review of Lotto evidently by an enemy (whether personal or merely an enemy to \u201cMorellianism\u201d) in The Nation.\nI went down to Florence \u2014 it seems like a real expedition \u2014 and shopped and called on Emily. \nSaw Miss Boord in the street. \nEmily says all the German women she knows adore Ekkehardt as a real book!\nWe read Coleridge in the evening. \nRay has learned to skate. Mother writes that she can get all round the Regent Park Pond, \u201cwith her little legs wide apart and her arms waving like windmills.\u201d The angel! \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, February 9, 1895\nTook notes from Lafenestre. \nMr. Hamilton came to lunch. \nWalked. \nRead Nietzsche, one of the Chansons de Geste, Boissier, Perry\u2019s Greek Literature and in <the> evening Aristophanes\u2019 Knights. \n[p98] \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, February 10, 1895\nVilla Rosa, Fiesole\nLetter from Reinach saying Bernhard\u2019s article after all can\u2019t go in the Revue arch\u00e9ologique. Disappointment. \nLoeser and Emily came to lunch, and we walked and talked.\nWe read the Knights in the evening. \nBernhard was feeling low and said, \u201cI can never write again.\u201d He is like a tree. His leaves haven\u2019t begun to put out yet, and he thinks the winter past will endure facon. By June he will be in full leaf, and will hate to tear himself away from Fiesole. \nEmily said, when I told her the S. Marco Giotto was genuine, \u201cWhy, it has so many traditions about it being Giotto. I never thought it could be genuine!\u201d \u2014 quite naively. \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, February 11, 1895\nBegan article on Lafenestre\u2019s Florence.\nIt rained, but I went into Florence and had a \n[p99] \nlook round the Uffizi with Emily. \nIn the evening we read B.\u2019s paper on Literature being the account of the struggle of the individual to assert himself against all the forces that tend to crush him and keep him down. We discussed it and also Rosny. \nBernhard\u2019s review of Ulmann\u2019s Botticelli in the Revue critique came.\n\n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, February 12, 1895\nA very lazy day. I was ill all the afternoon, but in the morning I took notes for the Lafenestre article.\nBernhard dipped about into all sorts of books.\nI began Perry\u2019s English Literature in the XVIII Century. \nWe both read Theodore Marzials\u2019 poems all through, I don\u2019t know why. This is a sample: \nSwee\nWake\nHere, take\nMy heart in your hand,\nBreak. \nFinished the Knights.\n[p100] \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, February 13, 1895, Fiesole \nThe great event of the day was the arrival and spreading of our Japanese rugs. \nI wrote my Lafenestre review in the morning. \nBernhard went in to Florence, and I arranged things a little in his house, for his remark that it looked \u201cjust like a priest\u2019s house\u2019 touched my heart!\nIn the evening we read a little Browning before Maud went down to write letters, and afterwards I read Symonds\u2019 Greek Poets,\n Perry, etc., while Bernhard read medieval French poetry. \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, February 14, 1895 \n[Mary\u2019s 31st birthday]\nI spent quite a time this morning thinking over the \u201clessons of the year\u201d. I believe the upshot of it all is a hatred of any kind of deceit \u2026 a most valuable lesson to learn, if\n I really have leant it. \nWe wrote in the morning, and then Bernhard went to lunch with the Scotts and Maud and I went to call on Miss Belle Duffy,\n who is staying with Mr. Hamilton. She was very sniffy. \nWe tried to read Emerson\u2019s so-called poetry in the evening, but it was a failure. Ditto Poe. \n[p101] \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, February 15, 1895 \nAt work on the pamphlet about the New Gallery. \nEmily came to lunch, and we had a talk about Paolo Uccello, Domenico Veneziano, and Andrea Castagno.\nBernhard went to see Salvini in one of Scribe\u2019s plays in the evening, and spent the night with Loeser. Loeser was busy writing something to prove that Bernhard\u2019s Lotto was all wrong. When at last it came to a question of what he based himself on, he pulled out a drawing which, to him, was Alvise Vivarini\u2019s only authentic drawing, and which turned out to be \u2014 \u2014 a Flemish copy of a group from Filippino\u2019s frescoes in S. Maria sopra Minerva!! und so weiter. \n$$HEADER$$_x Saturday, February 16, 1895\nWorked, walked, talked and read. \n[p102] \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, February 17, 1895, Fiesole\nWorked in the morning, and after lunch I went in to see Bernhard off to Milan, where he is going on business.\nThen I called on Emily, and afterwards came on up. \nFinished Fogazzaro\u2019s Daniele Cortis.\n \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, February 18, 1895\nFinished and sent off the pamphlet on the New Gallery. \nMiss Paget came to call, bringing with her as usual a topsy-turvy literary world which reminds me that the other night as we were talking of Henry James, and the sterile type of American he writes about, Bernhard compared it to a botanist spending all his time on those bits of pollen-dust that are blown out to sea and never fertilize anything. \nAlso he compared the Bicci to Darwin\u2019s earth worms, digging up the artistic soil, the uneducated public, \n[p103] \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, February 19, 1895\nI took a long walk over the hills in the pine forests with Bianca, the white dog. \nBernhard came home to dinner.\n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, February 20, 1895\nEmily came up and we had a walk and tea in the garden, in the sun.\nWorked on the Lafenestre, read German. \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, February 21, 1895 \nBernhard lunched at the Rasponis, I in town, renewing acquaintance with the dear oysterman. \nMet Emily at the Academy and looked at Botticellis, Filippos, and Neri di Biccis. \nThen went to Sant\u2019Apollonia and the Cenacolo di Fuligno.\n \nBernhard came to tea at Emily\u2019s and we walked up. \nMother wrote that Miss Sellers was sent for to nurse Frau Furtw\u00e4ngler through the illness consequent upon the attempt to cure her of the opium habit \u2014 and that she had gone, not knowing. It almost drove her crazy. Also that Miss Sellers did not go to Paris because Reinach wrote so enthusiastically of Bernhard\u2019s opinions on Greek art, and she felt he could know \n[p104] \nvery little about it, and didn\u2019t want to quarrel with Reinach over it. The truth is that Bernhard opened R.\u2019s eyes to the idea of qualitative as opposed to quantitative criticism. \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, February 22, 1895, Fiesole\nQuarrelled in a sort of way in the morning. At any rate, spent our time talking. \nIn the afternoon arranged photos. \nFabbri came to dinner. He said that when he dined with Loeser, Loeser spent all his time trying to prove that Whistler is a superior artist to Degas. \nAfter he had gone, I read the Fac\u00e9ties de Pogge.\n\n$$HEADER$$_x Saturday, February 23, 1895 \nWrote Lafenestre in the morning, and arranged Bernhard\u2019s books and had a short walk in the afternoon, and Lafenestre again in the evening. \nMiss Cruttwell said her proudest treasure in her \u201ctrophy\u201d days, was the end of a young man\u2019s moustache which \n[p105] \nhe had sent her, wrapped in paper, as a proof of devotion. \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, February 24, 1895 \nLoeser and Emily came up to lunch and we had a long walk over the hills. \nAfter tea Loeser discoursed on religion, and Miss Cruttwell drew me aside to ask if he had softening of the brain! \nEmily stayed all night. \nBegan Ferrari\u2019s R\u00e9volutions d\u2019Italie.\n \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, February 25, 1895 \nWorked.\nBernhard lunched with the Ogilvys. \nI walked to the Palmerino and back.\nWe read L\u2019Allegro and Il Penseroso in the evening, and I finished Old Mortality.\n \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, February 26, 1895 \nGerman, etc., in the morning.\nIt was warm a scirocco and the snow all melted, at last! \nWe discussed Scott\u2019s novels and Bernhard compared a good novel to a well-composed picture, with the plans of foreground, middle distance and background well kept. Scott, like a great painter, only \n[p106] \nputs in enough detail in the middle distance to indicate the salient character of the person (cf. Impressionist and miniature painting), whereas Flaubert in L\u2019education sentimentale, and often the de Goncourts, crowd their middle distance with detail, etc. Interesting criticism.\nAfter our walk, suddenly Fafner Hapgood came, and we spent the rest of the day and evening talking. He stayed here all night. He is a great dear. He had dined on Sunday night with Obrist, whom he liked.\n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, February 27, 1895 \nWent in with Fafner and saw the Academy, Pitti and Uffizi.\nTook tea at Loeser\u2019s.\nRead Evan Harrington.\n\nThe day was rather spoiled for me by getting irritated at Bernhard, who was very rude to me in the gallery, over one of the Fra Angelicos, when I agreed with Fafner that its colour was horrible. Thereafter, being irritated himself, he strove to say as many annoying things as he could. \n[p107] \nI suppose my remarks on the icture were not as edifying as they might have been. It is really too silly to fight. Why on earth should we?\n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, February 28, 1895 \nAwoke to a fierce snow-storm! But it was gone, and all the snow, too, by afternoon.\nEmily and Miss Anstruther Thomson came to lunch, and Bernhard talked to us enchantingly about the early Sienese. \nWe had a nice walk, and I finished the Lafenestre in the evening. \nMrs. Jack Gardner wrote that she would take <the> 2 Peruzzis Bernhard wrote to her about, thereby causing us to rejoice, for we are low in funds and this means about \u00a370. \n[p108] \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, March 1, 1895 \nSent off the review of Lafenestre. \nMaud and I lunched with Loeser and I had tea with Emily.\nBernhard called on the Morgans.\nBegan Richard Feverel (second time of reading). \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, March 2, 1895 \nRain all day. \nWe finished our German story, Don Juan von Kolomea.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Benn came to lunch.\nWe read Bernhard\u2019s essay on Mohamed in the evening.\nFinished Richard Feverel. \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, March 3, 1895 \nBegan Einsame Menschen by Hauptmann.\n\nLoeser came to lunch and we had an enchanting walk. The day began with snow, but the afternoon was lovely and we had tea in the garden. \nRead parts of the Koran in the evening. \n[p109] \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, March 4, 1895 \nGerman etc., in the morning. \nToo snowy to go to town.\nBut the afternoon was wonderful, and after posting Bernhard\u2019s review of the Burlington Ferrarese Catalogue, we took one of the nicest walks we have ever had along the road to Monte Senario and through the poderi. The streams were bursting out in every direction. Bernhard said the pleasure the sound of rushing water gives our ears is equivalent to the pleasure our eyes take in a swirl of lines.\nWhen we returned Miss Paget and Miss Thomson were here, and we chatted and looked at photos. \nBernhard went to dine with them, and I studied German and read Ferrari,\n etc. \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, March 5, 1895 \nA heavy snow-storm all day!! \nRead Einsame Menschen, Nietzsche, \n[p110] \nBoissier, Ferrari, and Pater\u2019s last book, Greek Studies.\n\nAfter reading \u201cHippolytus Unveiled\u201d, I read the translation of it in Perry. \nTalked a good deal about Furtw\u00e4ngler and Janet.\nM. Reinach\u2019s translation of my conte-rendu of Lotto came in proof and we corrected it. \nWe took our \u201crampart walk\u201d in spite of the snow. \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, March 6, 1895 \nRead German. \nCalled at Palmerino in the afternoon. \nRead Border Ballads at night. \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, March 7, 1895 \nEmily came to lunch, and Miss Thomson and the countess Rasponi afterwards to a lecture on Giotto. Bernhard walked home with the latter and I with Emily. \nLoeser called and stayed with Maud, explaining his ideas of the chronology of Botticelli.\nWe talked about visual images vs. symbolism in the drawings of children. \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, March 8, 1895 \nSaw the new Botticelli Athena taking a Centaur captive. Our party was ourselves, Miss Thomson, a Miss \n[p111] \nMurray-Scott, the Count and Countess Rasponi, Miss Gordigiani and Emily. It is a real and immensely interesting Botticelli to be ranked next to the Primavera, the Venus and the Villa Lemmi frescoes in importance.\nBernhard and I did some shopping and drove up. \nHouse furnished in the afternoon, arranging his spare-room and re-arranging mine.\nRead in the evening. \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, March 9, 1895 \nBernhard\u2019s pamphlet on the Venetian Exhibition at the New Gallery came. Mr. Cook writes that they keep it for free distribution at the Gallery, as they do not like to sell it. It reads very well. \nWalked, wrote letter, read more Border Ballads. \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, March 10, 1895 \n(Karin 6 years old!)\nLoeser came to lunch, and stayed to tea.\nI read Meige\u2019s pamphlets on various forms of alienation in connection with Greek art.\n We finished Einsame Menschen \n[p112] \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, March 11, 1895\nVilla Rosa, Fiesole\nBegan Wahlverwandtschaften.\nWorked on Ferrarese lists. Read a book on Prostitution dans l\u2019Antiquit\u00e9, which gave me bad dreams.\nRead some Rossetti and early German poetry. \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, March 12, 1895 \nWe are both reading Nietzsche these days, I still plodding along in Jenseits von Gut und B\u00f6se.\nBernhard has finished G\u00f6tzend\u00e4mmerung and is now reading Also sprach Zarathustra.\nHe is also reading Montaigne. \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, March 13, 1895 \nAnother quiet day of books. \nBernhard went in to dine with the Frenches, and Maud continued her biography for my benefit, which we take occasion to go on with when he is away.\n \nI have a read respect for people who can make their history so objective and can be really sincere about it that is the real way to help on the world. \n[p113] \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, March 14, 1895 \nCalled at Loeser\u2019s for Bernhard and we did a lot of shopping. \nMiss Thomson and Emily came to lunch, and the Countess Rasponi after, and we had an interesting lecture on Donatello, after which Bernhard and I took a walk.\nAt dinner and until 9 we discussed ballads, what they are. \nI read Nietzsche till 10.30 while Bernhard went on reading early German ballads. \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, March 15, 1895 \nWent to the Scalzi with Maud, Emily and Miss Thomson, then to the Academy. \nMaud and I lunched with Loeser, then Bernhard and I called on Miss <Janet> Dodge and came up here, meeting Loeser and Maud on the way. \nA wonderful night We walked out to Fiesole and saw the stars. \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, March 16, 1895 \nWent to Vernon Lee\u2019s and had a \u2018santa conversazione\u2019, chiefly about Lauder.\n She is \u00e0 rebours as usual! \n[p114] \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, March 17, 1895, Fiesole \nLoeser, Emily and Miss Jane<t> Dodge, Fafner\u2019s friend, came to lunch. We had a walk, tea, much talking, etc. She is a delicate, sensitive little creature, in looks and temperament, much like Evalyne. \nQuite tired with so much chatting and laughter.\nThe editor of The Atlantic wrote to ask me to send him an article on Morellianism.\nBernhard unwell. \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, March 18, 1895 \nPlacci took Bernhard to Alessandri\u2019s, where he found 2 Pesellinis and some Ben. Gozzolis. He stayed to lunch with Placci, Ginori and Buonamici.\nI had a note from Ephrussi of the <Gazette des> Beaux Arts asking me to contribute notes on Italian things. \nAfter tea we had a walk.\nBernhard felt better, but still feeble. \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, March 19, 1895 \nAlys and Berty arrived at about 9.30, Emily bringing them.\nThe whole day passed in talk, etc. \n[p115] \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, March 20, 1895 \nA quiet day of work and talk.\nBallads in the evening. \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, March 21, 1895 \nEmily came to lunch and we had a lecture on Botticelli. \nMiss Lowndes came to tea and we read Keats and Wordsworth in the podere.\nFabbri came to dinner. I had to write to Burke, whose wife has decided now to separate from Carr, starved out, I fear, without a penny. I am afraid Burke will take her back, and, as they are au fond uncongenial, the tragedy will just begin again. \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, March 22, 1895 \nLunched with Loeser, we three, Emily and Miss Dodge. \nThe latter came home to tea here, while Bernhard was taken by Fabbri to call on Miss Blood.\nA most amusing and brilliant letter from HO giving his \u201cimpressions\u201d of Berty.\n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, March 23, 1895 \nMiss Lowndes to lunch. I developed a mild \n[p116] \ninfluenza. \nCharles Dudley Warner called again. He defined sin as \u201csomething bourgeois\u201d. \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, March 24, 1895, Fiesole \nLoeser and Miss Dodge to lunch, Emily after, and then Fafner arrived.\nWe read The Rime [sic] of the Ancient Mariner and Christabel in the garden before and after tea. \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, March 25, 1895 \nQuiet day with influenza.\nEmily and her mother came to tea. Bernhard took Berty to see some churches, and then to call upon Mr. Benn. \nBerty and Alys lunched with the Dawsons, and Berty was indignant at the stupid nonsense they talked to him. He said he wanted to put up a sign, \u201cRubbish not to be shot here\u201d. \nWe read ballads in the evening and discussed: What is a ballad? The nearest we could come is \u201ca simple shot poem dealing with situations that call upon elementary emotions, generally tending to the weird\u201d. \n[p117] \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, March 26, 1895 \nMiss Lowndes and Carlo Placci came to lunch. They were both nice, and Placci briliant, a most engaging personality. \nAfter lunch we lay out in the garden and smoked and talked. Placci says he is ceasing more and more to react pleasurably to music, the more he knows it. Bernhard suggested that is must be because he takes, after all, merely an amateur\u2019s interest, which doesn\u2019t lead on and on as a professional interest would.\nThen Herr and Frau von der Hellen came to call, Weimar friends of Obrist, ex-cess-ively German in appearance. He is Nietzsche\u2019s editor,\n a most intelligent man. She paints and makes a feeble German-woman effort to be a person, but doesn\u2019t seem to succeed very well. \nIn the evening Bertie read aloud the Book of Job and we read part of Prometheus Bound.\nPoor Alys gets so bored and sleepy with all these talks and readings, and keeps continually looking at her watch, and tries to cheer herself up by thinking of the things \u2026 \n[p118] \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, March 27, 1895 \nEmily and Miss Dodge came and we walked with them to Mr. Morgan\u2019s, up on the hill.\nRead Job in the evening. \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, March 28, 1895 \nMiss Lowndes, Miss Dodge and Emily came to lunch, and Miss Thomson and the Countess Rasponi afterwards. We had a lecture on Fra Angelico.\nMr. and Mrs. Hapgood and Fafner came up at 3.30, also Evelyn\u2019s friend Miss Hale and Mary and Eliza Stuart, and we had a huge (for us!) tea, and then all walked down through the podere.\nStill influenza.\n$$HEADER$$_Friday, March 29, 1895 \nA rather lazy day, with a feeling of influenza.\nSent off a note to the Chronique des Arts. \nC. D. Warner called in the afternoon, and was most charming. He told us a lot about the natural oil regions in America, and the Grand Ca\u00f1on of the Colorado.\nFinished Job.\nBernhard got \u00a338.6.10 for two months of his Lotto. \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, March 30, 1895 \nBernhard lunched with Placci and called on the Toys, and had a long talk with Mr. Toy. I had a quiet day of writing.\nWe read Esther in the evening. \n[p119] \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, March 31, 1895 \nLoeser came to lunch, and stayed and nearly drove me crazy talking, when the others all went out.\nFafner still here. \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, April 1, 1895 \nRainy and cloudy. \nLord Ronald Gower \u2014 a noted Sodomite \u2014 came with an introduction from Mr. Hamilton Aid\u00e9 to Bernhard, and behaved in a most sickening way, evidently falling in love with him at first sight.\nWe read Luke in the evening. \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, April 2, 1895\nRainy. \nMr. Benn and Miss Hale came to lunch. We read a lot of ballads and Mr. Benn added to our definition that it must be in short lines. \nTalked with Miss Hale about Evelyn. \nThen a long, long talk with Bernhard, who certainly is trying hard to pull along after him the \u201cslow-trotting Palma\u201d, who seems for the moment (if it is only that) to have fallen asleep where she\n stood. \nWhy have I lost heart, I wonder, just when everything is beginning to succeed? Is it because I care too much about HO? \n[p120] \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, April 3, 1895, Fiesole\nThe von der Hellens came to lunch and talked interestingly about \u201cKleine[r] Eyolf\u201d.\nMr. and Mrs. Hapgood came to tea. \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, April 4, 1895 \nMrs. Lowndes and Miss Dodge came to lunch, and Miss Thomson to the lecture afterwards on the Pollaiuoli and Alessio Baldovinetti.\nA walk and long bitter talk with Bernhard. All night long I tried hard to put things in their real proportions. The predominant thing is that we love each other. Everything else is secondary and can be arranged. I suffered very acutely in the night thinking how different I was from the kind of person I think I am.\n$$HEADER$$_Fiesole, Friday, April 5, 1895 \nAll the morning talking. I hope an impression is really made on me! I mean to start on with fresh heart. \nPlacci came to lunch and tea and was as charming as usual.\nBernhard called on Theodore Davis and his party. \nWe read my essay on \u201cArt Criticism\u201d in the evening. \n[p121] \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, April 6, 1895 \nWent in to Florence and saw Santa Maria Novella.\nAlys and Berty, Bernhard, Fafner, Miss Dodge and I lunched with the Hapgoods.\nBernhard, Bertie and Benn took a long walk and came back to tea.\nWonderful moonlight. \nNot relapsed.\n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, April 7, 1895 \nLoeser came to lunch and we went to the Palmerino for a \u201cSanta Conversazione\u201d on de Quincy. \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, April 8, 1895 \nMichael Field arrived and came up to lunch and spend the day.\nBertie and Alys went.\nMiss Lowndes and her aunt called and we walked in the podere. \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, April 9, 1895 \nPreparation for the Mikes and for going away. \n[p122] \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, April 10, 1895 \nEstablished Michael Field in Bernhard\u2019s apartment and left before lunch. \nBernhard joined the Davis\u2019 for a trip to Siena, Perugia, Bologna, Milan and Bergamo, and then went to visit Mrs. Jack Gardner at Venice, while I went to stay with the children and see the Champ de Mars in Paris.\nWe met again at: \n\n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, April 28, 1895\nHotel San Marco, Modena \nMet at 2. Looked at Cathedral and gallery. Both completely boulevers\u00e9 about art-theories. \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, April 29, 1895\nVilla Rosa, Fiesole\nHome again! \nWe went to San Pietro, the Cathedral and the gallery in the morning, and came here in the afternoon. \nThe Mikes are here. \nThe Doctrine defined beauty as the \u201ceternally desirable\u201d, and said the \n[p123] \nfunction of art was to reveal that to us \u2014 che cambiamento!! \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, April 30, 1895 \nCalled on Frau von der Hellen and Mrs. Benn. \nA long talk in the evening about the origin of aesthetic emotion. The doctrine was that \u201cthe intellect is a misappropriation of funds meant to ruin the sexual bank\u201d, and if you misappropriate too much, you go bankrupt. \nMiss Cruttwell gave utterance to the opinion that the only thing that could make the sexual act \u201cbearable\u201d was the reasoned desire to have a child. Yet she supposes herself to love and understand poetry!! \n[p124]\n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, May 7, 1895, Villa Rosa, Fiesole\nPoets are people who go straight from feeling to expression, not via thought.\nOne\u2019s results are, after all, only moments in one\u2019s thoughts. \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, May 10, 1895 \nI have not written. I have just been struggling to live, that is to keep happy and feel a springing up of vitality, so necessary to \u201cliving\u201d in any satisfactory sense. \nI had a rather knock-down blow, although it ought not to have been unexpected, in realizing that the children must be inevitably trained as Catholics. I had planned before just what I could do and could not, and saw no reason to change my mind. But \n[p125] \nthe actual realization of it has been stunning \u2026 or rather, I feel as if a leak had been sprung, and a lot of my life-blood were being drained off. I can\u2019t seem to recover myself, or stop the leak, and the sky might almost as well be leaden or smashing for all the difference it makes.\nThe Michael Fields have been a constant surface annoyance with their fussy and affected ways, that is to say, Michael, for Field comes as near to being a non-entity as a living creature bodily present can. I fancy she drains off most of her vitality into a huge journal she keeps. It is probably full of intense emotions and keen observations, but they are almost lost to her friends. I say \n[p126] \nalmost, for in spite of her quiet, which I find infinitely less irritation than Michael\u2019s chatter and giggles, one has to give her credit for a good deal of brains and extraordinary, perhaps to herself torturing, sensibility.\nTheir friend Louie Ellis came to tea and dinner yesterday, bringing her travelling companion, Miss Hall, a Newnham lecturer on classical subjects. She was beautiful in feature, but so detestably stiff and quiet in the real British way. That I hated her almost as OH would have done. \nThe day before his friends, the von der Hellens came, bringing with them a young painter, perhaps HO\u2019s most intimate German friend, names Curt Stoeving.\n We talked about Klinger, and he actually admired the \n[p127] \nbrutal horrors which are this year in the Champ de Mars. \nB. B. went to dine with them at the Aurora, expecting talk. Herr v. d. H. <Hellen> and Stoeving \u201ckneiped\u201d instead in a riotous way, drinking between them a whole fiasco of wine, shouting songs, giving their orders to the waiter in bass and tenor solos, and, worst of all, making faces the the others to laugh at. No! It is too late. \u201cWe others\u201d can\u2019t do these things, they seem crude and even ugly to us. A barrier is set between us and the Germans \u2026 on that side. No doubt they, for their part, were only too happy to be away from the \u201cstiff, English afternoon tea\u201d decorum of the Villa Rosa. \nStoeving I \n[p128] \nliked, but I have no vitality to spare to make new friends I care about. And then the gulf that separates a German \u2014! You think they are delicate and refined and sensitive (like HO), and so they are in some respects, and then they are capable of throwing it all overboard and wallowing. We others make at any rate a faint endeavour not to be pigs anywhere, but Germans, as Bernhard says, do not seem to feel any \u201cresponsibility toward small things\u201d. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nI am tired in heart, I can\u2019t keep a feeling of almost wickedness at letting the children become Catholics. \n[p129] \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, May 13, 1895, Fiesole\nPlacci and Prince Wolkonski came to lunch on Saturday. We had a nice talk about Beauty. \nOn Sunday, Emily came to tea and Fabbri to dinner. All he could say about the effect on him of a work of art was that it \u2018put him into a kind of dreamy state\u2019. Michael\n said it made her feel \u201cGod\u2019s in his heaven, all\u2019s well with the world.\u201d Her friend, Miss Ellis, said it made her want to cry, and Miss Hall said it made her pray. \n[p130]\n$$HEADER$$_May 13, 1895\nIn the arbour at tea time Field asked whether pathos ever was an element of great art. At first we thought not, but I, who play the part of bringing up \u201cthe objections that might occur to the ordinary mind\u201d, brought up Oedipus in Colonus and King Lear. At last Bernhard said what we all meant. \u201cPathos is an element of art only as predicate, never as substantive! Wrong use of pathos \u201creligious\u201d pictures, Tennyson\u2019s In Memoriam and Tears, idle tears, even Pierre Loti. In a lyric outburst of grief it is the strong personality you keep bumping up against. An idea is like a canal in straight banks, flowing as it has to flow, with\n[p131] \nno surprise.\nGray\u2019s Elegy is a picture of pastoral life to which we hug up all the closer for the feeling that it must come to an end. \nIn Tears, idle tears, you feel the poet is using \u201cclich\u00e9s which he knows to be ticklers for the feelings\u201d. This is the fault of all bad but effective art: Marion Crawford, Rudyard Kipling, most English and German modern art. Also the graphic art that tends to concentrate interest upon that \u201ceasiest and surest tickler\u201d, the face.\nWhy is easy tickling bad?\nA large element in aesthetic pleasure is being made conscious of a surplus of energy. Cheap effects leave us where we were. Real art makes us work for our pleasure, and leaves us with a heightened feeling of intelligence at having been able to recognize its good points. Behind the obvious in Raphael is much that is not obvious, the recognition of which requires an immense intellectual effort. So in \n[p132] \nGoethe and Luca della Robbia. But you must not be required to work too hard and exhaust all your surplus energy.\nMichael and Field have two great \u201clife-sustaining lies\u201d, which it would be almost death to take away from them. One is that they are a great, though at present unappreciated, poet. The other is that they \u201cbelong together\u201d. Both \nthese things, in the opinion of all their friends, are hideously false. Yet no one dares to tell them. \nThey also indulge in other strange delusions, as that there is some mystic and very powerful affinity between Bernhard and Field, which he feels as well as she. She feels it intensely. It is always hard \u2014 unless you relentlessly expose yourself to the logic of facts \u2014 to believe that such emotions are not shared. And why should she be undeceived, after all? She is not one of those people who can stand truth, and who \n[p133] \neven think they want it, in human intercourse.\n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, May 14, 1895, Fiesole\nThe Mikes gone, and we breathe freer, physically and mentally. At the same time a feeling of having been rather hateful to them oppresses both Maud and myself. \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, May 15, 1895 \nBernhard began his Florentines. \nTwo of Maud\u2019s friends came to lunch, and we sit a long time listening to what one of them has to tell about Japan, where she lived many years. \nThe von der Hellens came to tea and we have a walk together. They dine here, and we leave them at San Domenico to \u201ckneip\u201d, while Bernhard and I go to a concert at Fabbri\u2019s. \nComing back at midnight, the Kneipers were still sitting on the balcony, pretty drunk by this time, roaring out idiotic \n[p134] \nspeeches. We stood in the starlight a long time and watched them, and felt them indeed a different race from ourselves.\nAt dinner the German lady greatly embarrassed Bernhard by caresses under the table. As she has had no conversation with him to speak of, it can\u2019t be a personal feeling. Perhaps it is merely a habit she has. He does not seem to have the least curiosity to find out which!\nEmily is staying here for a few days. \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, May 16, 1895 \nWe studied Mantegna in the morning, and read Vasari. Had a lecture on \u201cWhat I don\u2019t know about Verocchio\u201d from B.B. in the afternoon, and after tea a little talk about aesthetic emotion. It began with Bernhard\u2019s wail that he could not write about the Florentines, because he no longer enjoyed them, as a school. He looked back to a time when he \u201cenjoyed\u201d all of Pollaiuolo, \n[p135] \neven such a thing as the Berlin Annunciation. Now he recognized that it gave him pleasure (though he did not analyze it at the time) as a piece of \u201cinstantaneously effective archaeology\u201d. \nWhy do we get more pleasure from art than from nature? (if we do) It is a peculiar enhancement of life to know that man did it, not a god. This is an aesthetic emotion in so far as it is a real leap of life upwards, giving you a greater sense of power. \nFrom a steamboat a great machine you get a certain sense of power, but of a less intense quality. Machinery only increases the commodities of life, and adds to the life itself.\nWhat is life? A sense of functioning and increased life is an increased sense of ease and endlessness in every possible way of functioning. Art enhances this feeling, which is at the bottom of all pleasure. \n[p136]\nA clergyman once remonstrated with a negro about beating his child, and told him he oughtn\u2019t to do it when he was angry, anyhow. \u201cBut what would be the use of it then?\u201d enquired the negro!\nAn American woman who longed to see a rhinoceros, and haunted circuses, at last found one. \u201cMy! ain\u2019t he plain!\u201d was her comment. \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, May 17, 1895, Fiesole \nShopping in Florence in the morning. \nSignor Puliga came to lunch. He is a disciple of Sar Peladan.\n We talked a good deal about French literature. The only people he seemed to care for, except the Sar, were Anatole France \u2014 comme penseur, surtout!! \u2014 and Henri Reginer.\n \u201cArtist\u201d meant to him merely the man who used words well. Bernhard and I \n[p137] \ntalked about Nietzsche, whose value, according to him, is that he consistently hates all that makes against life and loves all that makes for it. His concrete admirations are constantly changing, but his criteria of excellence \u2014 Wertsch\u00e4tzungen \u2014 remain astonishingly the same. His Geburt der Trag\u00f6die is the best thinking on aesthetics from our point of view, the really psychological, that Bernhard knows. \nMr. Warner came in at tea-time and told us abut the Mexican cliff dwellers and other out-of-the-way, interesting things. \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, May 18, 1895 \nAn earthquake at 8.53 p.m. lasting 5 seconds. We were at dinner at the Palmerino. \n[p138]  \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, May 26, 1895, Villa Rosa, Fiesole \nWe went on a giro, Bernhard, Maud, Emily and I. First to Pistoia (Albergo Rossini), then Lucca (x Hotel de l\u2019Univers) with a day\u2019s drive to Barga (25 fr, 2 horses) ending up at Pisa (Nettuno). \nThe whole trip was harmonious and pleasant. We all enjoyed it.\nThe pleasant things were\n1. Giovanni Pisano\u2019s pulpit and the Scaloppe a Marsala at Pistoia. Also Santa Maria Umilt\u00e0.\n2. Ilaria\u2019s tomb at Lucca, away and above everything else.\n3. The scenery on the drive to Barga, the so-spelt \u201cGolopine\u201d at lunch, and a great carved wooden S. Christopher with huge staring eyes, behind \n[p139] \nthe High Altar of the Duomo. Also a drink of warm milk I extracted from a cow by the wayside. \n4. The Giovanni Pisanos and Simone Martinis at Pisa, and the row down the river in a fisherman\u2019s barge, with a sight of the camels feeding along the bank. \nToday at lunch Bernhard suddenly broke out in praise of the Degas on the mantelpiece, \u201cthe greatest of all works of art.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u2026 A good deal of hesitation and feeling round, and at last the right reason hit on the head, because it conveys life directly. He has deserted the theory that art is to \u201cuplift\u201d, or \u201cbroaden\u201d life, or any \n[p140] \nhygienico, social or moral view of its mission. That may or may not be, but the essence of essences is to be a sheath, an envelope of just \u201cplain life\u201d, effects of space and composition belong to architecture, and are rightly called in painting \u201carchitectonic\u201d. But painting can communicate life, livingness, itself. This is the purely aesthetic artistic standard of art. Whether it resembles or not is aside from the mark. Painting can convey life more forcibly, more essentially, than the living thing itself. Neither Maud nor I looked half so much alive as Degas\u2019 ballet-girl bending down to tie her slipper. We were not sheaths of aliveness as the painter made \n[p141] \nthat figure. This idea, unclearly felt after, is at the bottom of most criticism, from Vasari\u2019s \u201cpare vivo\u201d down. But most people can\u2019t imagine it can convey life unless it is as much like the living thing as possible. Hence most bad criticism, such as mother\u2019s contempt for the Japanese, who seem to be the greatest \u201clife-bearers\u201d of all. \nNietzsche\u2019s Wertsch\u00e4tzungen, which are all reducible to the one criterion whether it makes for or against life, have helped forward Bernhard\u2019s ideas, although Nietzsche, while railing against any such intention, is au fond very hygienic. While Bernhard\u2019s \n[p142] \nbeating his brains to find the kernel of the artistic element in the work of art. \nThere remains the question whether these \u201carchitectonic effects\u201d are not equally life-bearing with the suggestion of movement, etc., which Bernhard calls the heart of hearts of art?? \nWe went to the Palmerino and heard a rather platitudinous lecture from Vernon Lee on \u201cArt and Life\u201d. \nMr. Benn said that \u201cthe people quaked more than the earth\u201d. Still it was a severe shock. The old earth shook herself like a Newfoundland dog coming out of the water.\n[p143] \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, May 29, 1895, Fiesole \nMonday passed quietly, Bernhard studying Giotto, and spending night at Loeser\u2019s. \nTuesday I lunched at Emily\u2019s, and her mother talked such a lot of commonplace weariness that I thought of Bertie\u2019s protest against her, \u201cNo rubbish shot here\u201d. She does shoot rubbish?\nAnother series of untrue platitudes from Vernon Lee, under the head of \u201cArt and Luxury\u201d. The funny thing was the audience, consisting chiefly of Countesses Rasponi, Pasolini, Jennison, Niccolini, Count Papafava, and then the commoners Fabbri, Mr. Baring and ourselves. \nToday I began getting ready the children\u2019s \u201cThinking Lessons\u201d for publication.\nMr. Benn came to lunch and took a walk with Bernhard.\nCount Puliga, the von der Hellens with their children, and Mr. C. D. Warner to tea. \n[p144] \nOscar Wilde is emprisoned for two years, with hard labour. It makes me quite miserable, for although I came to the conclusion he was somehow a loathesome [sic] beast when he was here last spring, yet surely he was so much more use than harm \u2014 even granting the charges are true. And when you think of how common the vice is, it is sickening to think that the punishment has fallen on the most brilliant of them all. To have known him so well! It is horrible to have to think what his feelings must be. \nPoor Oscar! I have a secret hope it may turn out well for him in the end, for I believe him capable of better work than he has ever done. \n[p145]\n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, June 12, 1895 \nLife has been going on quietly.\nThe von der Hellens, Benns, Placci and a socialist friend of his named Gaetano Salvemini (a brilliant boy of 22), Mr. Morgan, Loeser, Count Papafava, Count Puliga, Fabbri, Emily, etc., have all been here from time to time. Now they have all gone except Placci and his friend and Mr. Morgan and Puliga, and of them we see little. Even Maud has gone, and Bernhard and I are living quietly here, he writing his Florentine Painters, and I type-writing it and doing the lists, and writing out the \u201cThinking Lessons\u201d, etc., busy and happy.\nBut I am lazy about writing, and all that is important now will go into the Florentines, for it is our meat and drink. \n[p146] \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, June 13, 1895\nB.B. working on his Florentine Painters, wrote a chapter on Masaccio that thrilled me. Each word brought out Masaccio\u2019s inner significance. I have not often had such a thrill of pleasure as when he read it to me. \nWe walked in the afternoon to Mr. Morgan\u2019s. \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, June 14, 1895\nFabbri came to lunch, and was as much of a \u2018life-ralentisseur\u201d (Placci\u2019s phrase) as ever. He drove me to Florence, and when I came back I found Mr. and Mrs. Kerr-Lawson here. He is a Scotch painter, she a Canadian. They are living with the Priore of Settignano, a good-natured man run to death by his parish, whose one dream is to get a fortune by the Lotto, in which he and his mother take numbers every week, buy the Gamberaia Villa and live up \n[p147] \nthere and throw down the evil eye every morning upon his tiresome condatinacci who bore him so confessing their sins too often. After the earthquake he brought them each a little wax taper telling them to burn it reciting an Ave, after having taken a purge, in order to keep off another shock of earthquake. He is fearfully in debt, but he pretends that his creditors who come and stand patiently about, like saints in niches, waiting for small payments on account, are very grand people, Professori di Matematica, etc., a naive fraud which takes in no one. \nIn the evening Placci came to dinner, and he was quite delightful, so sympathetic about Bernhard\u2019s ideas on art, and so entertaining in gossip. \n[p148] \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, June 15, 1895, Fiesole\nI finished L\u2019Innocente,\n but did not like it <at> all. \nWe worked on the book, and I began to write my Louvre Guide.\nMr. Morgan came to dinner. We rather prize him, for he is a good representation of the old generation, and yet not \u201cgrunching\u201d, at least to us. Who knows what his sons will find him?\n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, June 16, 1895 \nA year ago we left Florence. Today we worked on as usual, but the book did not progress much. It looks as if it could not be finished before I must go. \nMr. and Mrs. Kerr-Lawson came to dinner and were nice. We had a long walk and discussed the pleasure we get from representations of movement, figures and drapery. \n[p149]\n$$HEADER$$_Monday, June 17, 1895\n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, July 3, 1895 \nAll this time at Fiesole grappling with the Book, and enjoying it very much. Every day we saw deeper into the \u201cwhy\u201d of real art enjoyment. Practically the whole will come out in Bernhard\u2019s books, but I do wish I had kept a record of our discussions from day to day. However, I was lazy and did not, and so I have missed the detailed memory of one of the happiest and most growing months of our lives.\nThe people we saw most of were the Kerr-Lawsons, Placci and his socialist friend Gaetano Salvemini, Count Papafava, and Mr. Morgan and Count Puliga. Placci was charming one night when we invited him to come and her Bernhard\u2019s \u201cdiscovery\u201d about why we enjoy pictures.\nTowards the end of the month \n[p150] \nthe mosquitoes and sand-flies became almost unbearable. Also we had a severe quarrel, but as we came to terms, and in fact understood each other better at the end than before, it did no harm. \nWe leave Florence tonight by the 9.05 train. \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, July 4, 1895\nHotel Sal\u00f2, Lago di Garda \nA lovely morning on the lake, a swim, a sight of the miserable Romanesque pictures and the fine Gothic Cathedral (what capitals!) of Sal\u00f2, and then a weary fight with mosquitoes and sand-flies.\n$$HEADER$$_Friday, July 5, 1895\nHotel del Sole, Riva\nAgain a swim, such delicious cool, blue water! and the sail along the lake here. A very nice hotel. \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, July 6, 1895\nHotel Trento, Trient \nWe took the 5 a.m. boat to Malcesine\n to see the G. dai Libri \n[p151] \nin the church, returning by the 10 o\u2019clock boat. The best of all was the beautiful Giorgionesque hostess at the little Caff\u00e9. \nWe missed the church by Solari at Riva, though Bernhard tried to make out it was a horrible little affair we were mis-directed to! Aha! \nArrived here about 8.30. \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, July 7, 1895, Trent\nThis is a town of splendid palaces, and above all the Renaissance part of the Castello. We have enjoyed it very much\n$$HEADER$$_Monday July 8. 1895\n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, July 9, 1895\nGasthaus zu Rose, Sterzing\nA quaint little Tyrolese town with charming walks, and most delicious bracing air. \nWe had a long walk to Woer,\n in which I was rather cross, as I got tired. \n[p152] \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, July 10, 1895\nHotel Marienbad, M\u00fcnchen \nWe reached here at 5 and Obrist met us, dressed in a jade-green suit, looking pretty and jolly.\nWe dined with him at the Maximilien Caf\u00e9 and talked a good deal. He seemed at times on the point of using Bernhard\u2019s formulas, but never attained it. \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, July 11, 1895, Munich\nI called on Miss Sellers and had some most amusing gossip. Particularly funny was her account of a Furtwangler reconciliation scene. \n[p153] \nWe called on Puck,\n went to the Secession (a bronze profile and a silver medal of Bismarck by Hildebrand), had a drive, and a long talk on socialism in the evening with Obrist\u2019s astonishingly clever friend P\u00f6llnitz.\n[p154] \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, July 12, 1895, Kochelsee\n\nGallery in the morning. \nMiss Sellers came to lunch at Obrist\u2019s, and at four we three started to come here, arriving about 8.30. All the way we talked. Saw Obrist\u2019s glorious new embroideries. \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday July 13, 1895\n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, July 14, 1895\nKochelsee\nSwims, walks and such divine talks. As Michael once said, \u201cI know from experience what it was to listen to the great teachers, like Sokrates and Abelard, whose words kindled men like flames, for I have heard \u2018The Doctrine\u2019 \u201d. So it has been. Obrist is a dear, but being an artist, he isn\u2019t a critic, and Bernhard has simply proved himself a divine critic, who knows what and why he enjoys. I have felt like a child between them, and have been simply overwhelmed with Bernhard\u2019s genius.\n[p155]\n[p156]\n[p157]\nsimple, matter of fact, almost casual way, as if Columbus had come back to Spain and you to an \u201cafternoon tea\u201d and said \u201cO, by the way I\u2019ve discovered land on the other side of the ocean.\u201d He wants Bernhard to set to work on an aesthetics at once. \nIn the afternoon we went to the Glaspalast to see Stoeving\u2019s picture, and then called on Miss Sellers and Miss Lowndes, who took us to Prof. Furtw\u00e4ngler\u2019s, where we had a pleasant call.\nWe dined with HO. On parting with B. B. he said some touchingly appreciative things about our coming. We have strengthened the native bent of his genius, which is towards unrepresentative decoration. We have not dared to tell him yet that we fear he is not au fond a sculptor, and he has native bad taste. German!! \n[p158] \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, July 17, 1895\n* Pf\u00e4lzenhof, Speyer\nWe reached Karlsruhe at 3 and saw the Gallery, a Lorenzo di Credi,\n Nic. d\u2019Alumno, and a picture we can\u2019t name, a charming Florentine thing close to Pesellino!\nAfter strolling about and looking at what Bernhard called the Dannerwettoriums of Karlsruhe, we came here and found an excellent hotel, sehr gem\u00fctlich. \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, July 18, 1895\nRheinischer Hof, Mainz\nSaw and were disappointed in the Speyer Dom. Everything that painting could do to make it hideous, has been done with calculation. It resembles a frigid Turkish Bath. The Crypt, however, is impressive, and the space effect from the choir good. \nThen we went to Worms, were depressed by the Lutherdenkmal and exhilarated by the magnificent grouping of towers of the Dom, particularly the west choir, and then came to this particularly poor, noisy hotel.\nBernhard saw the Museum of Antiquities at Speyer (I did not), head of Zeus, bronze with silver eyes, and xx small bronze bust of Tiberius \n[p159] \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, July 19, 1895, Mainz\nA most satisfactory day. We took a cup of black coffee at the station at 7, and then went by train to Frankfort a/M, reaching there at 8, where we had some stupendo coffee at the xx Casino. \nWe then \u201cdid\u201d the town, ending up at 10 at the St\u00e4del Institut, where we stayed till one. It is a splendid collection. Perhaps a huge triptych by Roger van der Weyden impressed us more than anything else, the splendidly decorative Christ on the Cross with a Japanese landscape, like a stronger, more human Crivelli.\nWe lunched at the Casino, expensive but good, with superb coffee! and then came back and \u201cdid\u201d the Museum here (Lorenzo di Credi, Defendente da Ferrari, and Tiepolo) and the Cathedral.\nDined at the xSchwann, 7 Liebfrauenplatz, an excellent place. \n[p160] \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, July 20, 1895\nRothes Haus, Trier\nCursed be the misunderstanding which made each of us think the other wanted to come down the Rhine by boat. We did it, and were bored to death! We went out from Coblentz to the Laachersee, to see the Benedictine Church there, and tired as we were we thoroughly enjoyed the exquisite little cloister in front of the east fa\u00e7ade. Ex-qui-site!\nWe had a nice supper at the xCentral Hof at Coblentz, and then came here, reaching this hotel about 11. \nThe trouble with the outside of most of these churches is that, as mass, they are rather inert compared to Notre Dame in Paris, Rheims, etc. Those look alive, like great beasts, or ships in full sail. These, with their modern Mansard roof, and generally rather ungainly masses, never suggest organic life. \n[p161] \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, July 21, 1895, Trier\nFirst we saw the impressive Cathedral, with its Roman feeling for space, then the Gothic \u201cMadonna delle Carceri\u201d, the exquisite Liebfrauenkirche, a cruciform equal-armed Gothic (the choir, however, being a little lengthened out). \nIn front a statue of the Synagogue came almost up to the Rheims things, except for the barbarous \u201cIdeenkunstler\u201d idea of making a huge crown toppling off one side of her head! Then we saw the ruins of the Palace, and the magnificent Basilica, prowled through the Museum and came back to a perfect gorge of a Sunday table d\u2019h\u00f4te! I could do nothing but sleep after, but I waked up eventually and copied in our notes. \nAfter supper we walked out and saw the bridge, and discussed the essence of poetry. \nI read Luria, In a Balcony, and The Soul\u2019s Tragedy, and Bernhard Hauptmann\u2019s Die Weber.\nThe Gasthof zum Post looked very nice and much quieter than this. \n[p162] \n[p163] \n$$HEADER$$_September 8, 1895, Chartres \nWe spent the day chiefly in the Cathedral, of which we admired the inner fa\u00e7ade most. The choir is trivial, but the opening out of the transept very grand.\nWe talked of course, endlessly.\n$$HEADER$$_September 9, 1895\nGrand Hotel de Blois, Blois \nWe saw Orl\u00e9ans, and enjoyed the Cathedral very much, though it is not \u2026 \n[p164] \n\nHotel de France, Bourges \n Our enjoyment of Tours was almost rapturous, the stained glass, particularly in the west rose window, was ecstatic and also our enjoyment of each other. \nBernhard has real hope for me in the future, and the gratitude and love I feel for him is indescribable.\n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, September 12, 1895, Paris \nThis was our best day of all. \nThe Cathedral of Bourges is simply unsurpassable! A great monster, really alive, from the outside, and inside \n[p165] \none long, absolutely perfect nave, and the finest stained glass in the world. \nWe passed practically one whole day there sitting quite dumb with rapture. \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, September 13, 1895\n3 rue de Beaune, Paris\nWe called on Reinach, who is unfortunately just leaving. His way of approaching art threw us both into gloom. It is so deadly. But he was personally most friendly. He went over the whole Louvre with us in the afternoon, and then took us to tea in the rue Royale, and sat and chatted a long time.\nI had to write letters all the evening.\n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, September 14, 1895, Paris\nWe went to the Louvre and Bernhard was a real angel in giving me notes for my Louvre book. Then we looked at the Venus from a new seat at the side from which her head \n[p166] \nappears really noble. \nAfter lunch we read the Introduction to Marshall\u2019s Pain, Pleasure and Aesthetics,\n and fell into a quarrel over the definition of pleasure.\nThe wrangle was renewed in the evening, and only after much bitterness of soul did we each succeed in modifying our statements sufficiently to admit that a definition of pleasure is still to seek, the nearest we can arrive at being: Pleasure is the feeling of the sort of life we desire, or the confirmation of our sense of capacity to attain it. \nBetween these wrangles we went to the Luxembourg, St-Severin and Notre Dame. At the Luxembourg there remains for us to enjoy: 1. the great Manet Olympia, a classic; 2. Puvis\u2019 Pauvre pecheur and two drawings; 3. \n[p167] \nWhistler\u2019s Portrait of his Mother; 4. Carri\u00e8re\u2019s Maternal Love. These seem to be \u201cthe last word\u201d, for they have been the same now for years. But almost anything might perish sooner than that great Manet. \nIt is delightful how sympathetically our taste works together. We generally feel the same, Bernhard of course more consciously, and sometimes ahead. But I am a close second. When our minds get to working so well in harness it will be truly delightful all round. At present we tend to fight, as in those old days over the writing of the Hampton Court Guide.\nWe are reading Maeterlinck\u2019s Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande. It is just like the Allandine et Palomides, but cruder. \n[p168] \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, September 15, 1895, Paris\nJohn Burke turned up to breakfast, and spent the day with us. We went to the Louvre in the morning and to St. Denis and the Town of Notre Dame in the afternoon. St. Denis impressed us less than <it did> three years ago, the grotesques, if anything, more. \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, September 16, 1895, Paris\nWe met Burke at Durand-Ruel\u2019s, where we saw some interesting Degases, and one important one, two women ironing. But best of all, supreme and classic, was a Manet, En Bateau, sunshine, blue sea, and a young man with the torso of a Greek god steering a boat. They have also Nana, a sort of F\u00eate Champ\u00eatre and a man and woman in a garden.\nAfter lunch we went to S. Gervais and found a Perugino, and through the terribly depressing gaudiness and bad taste of the Hotel de Ville, relieved by a Puvis de Chavannes room. He is the Giotto of today. Such satisfying tactile values, such simplicity. \nThen we \n[p169] \nwent into Notre Dame, but it failed to soothe us after the Hotel de Ville. The glass was horrible, and the interior did not go very well after Bourges. \nWe refreshed ourselves with tea, and then Burke and B.B. took a walk, and talked intimately about Burke\u2019s wife. She will have to give up her little baby, I fear. It seems to stand terribly in her way. Burke, I am sure loves her, but he no more ventures to stake everything on one hope. And if he takes her back with the child, it is all up between him and his sister.\n And he does not dare to lose that last refuge. He left after dinner, and I have been writing to his wife. \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, September 17, 1895, Paris\nWe finished our Florentine notes in the Louvre and met Miss Dodge there.\nAfter lunch we came back and looked at the Greek sculpture, particularly the Venus de Milo, and talked about the \u201cover-soul\u201d in art, which Bernhard \n[p170] \ndefined as an expression of complex of human desires.\n In its essence it is ethical, not merely plastic, or artistic. Emily writes to me today trying to express \u201cmy\u201d philosophy (a hopeless one, as I have proved, without something else, but Thou, when they should totter, teach them to stand fast.\u201d\n\u201cThee has made me believe in Joy as an attitude of mind qu\u2019il ne tient qu\u2019\u00e0 nous to assume towards Life, that we can cultivate our powers of enjoying if we will, so that all but momentary miseries will be excluded, excluded faute de place, the good things will crose the worries out.\u201d\nWe dined with Miss Dodge and Sturges at the Lap\u00e9rouse. Sturges was really very brilliant. He invented two terms for Oscar, \u201cthe great Unmentionable\u201d and \u201cthe great Unknowable\u201d. He told us about Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s lecture at Oxford. He is <a> professor of English here, and prides himself on being the one Frenchman who knows England and the English. He ended his lecture with \u201cMes chers duns\u201d. The joke is still going at Oxford.\nLittle Miss Dodge sat in a corner drinking in impressions of \u201cEuropean Life\u201d, the most exciting day, \n[p171] \nshe says, that she ever spent. \nSturges told us of one morning when Whistler came for Logan and met Zangwill in his rooms. Zangwill tried his \u201cnew humour\u201d at Whistler, without success. Leaning over him, he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d pointing to his decoration. \n\u201cThe Legion of Honour.\u201d \n\u201cI suppose they call it that,\u201d pursued Zangwell, \u201cbecause there are ten thousand of them knocking about the streets.\u201d \n\u201cIt is the way a great nation pays a great honour to a great artist,\u201d replied Whistler. \nSturges is most picturesque in talk. He refines a phrase until every word is significant. His defect is that he will not listen, and this habit is sure to grow on him, I fear. \n[p172] \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, September 18, 1895\nCrossing from Dieppe\nWe meet [sic] Herbert Cook in the Louvre and \u201cconnoshered\u201d a little. \nThen Miss Dodge, with whom we lunched.\nWaiting in the Salon Carr\u00e9 I discovered at last the cause for a certain unease I have always felt looking at Paolo\u2019s things, the fact that his people do not stand. Their legs hang rather listlessly, particularly from the knee down. \nWe went to the Luxembourg to show Miss Dodge a few of the pictures, and then Bernhard and I went to the Cluny and enjoyed the Gothic decorations and also found a Lorenzo Monaco. \nIn the evening I started for London. \nx  x  x\n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, September 26, 1895\n3 rue de Beaune, Paris\n During my stay at home Ray learnt \u201cthe trick\u201d of swimming and also of reading. \nI had several days with Aunty Lill, who urged me, in my peculiar circumstances, with little daughters growing up, etc., etc., to \u201cbe especially careful always to observe the Sabbath.\u201d She felt our souls had come very close together. \nBut the really important thing for me was meeting Mr. Hodgson, the Secretary of the \n[p173] \nAmerican Psychical Society, who convinced me that, through Mrs. Piper, their Medium, they have established communication with what he calls \u201cfragments of personality believing themselves to be George Pellew,\n Edmond Gurney,\n John Hund, etc., and inheriting their memories.\u201d In short, life beyond the grave. \nBesides this, I found, I hope, lovely parents to adopt Mrs. Burke\u2019s child.\nBernhard in the meantime was working at the drawings in the Louvre, seeing Janet <Dodge> and others, and especially seeing a great deal of Miss <Janet> Dodge, with whom he made a little expedition to Caen and Bayeux.\nSoon after I arrived he came, and we went out to the Louvre together. I lunched with Alban and his wife and sister, and joined Bernhard and Janey Dodge in the Louvre. We went to the Panth\u00e9on and St. Genevi\u00e8ve. \nI dined with Fabbri, and Bernhard with Mr. Bing, who showed him specimens of \u201cprimitive\u201d Japanese art, which make Outamaro seem decadent, like Parmigianino. \n[p174] \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, September 27, 1895\n3 rue de Beaune, Paris\nLouvre in the morning with Fabbri and his beautiful model St\u00e9phanie, a most Leonardesque creature. She and Miss Dodge lunched with us and we went to Durand-Ruel\u2019s and saw again the Manets and Degas. \nThen I came home and slept awhile. Janet Dodge moved over to this hotel, and we three dined together and sat and talked, and after Bernhard went, we had a good deal more talk, largely about Fafner.\n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, September 28, 1895, Paris\nWent to the Beaux Arts and the Louvre, but it was too terribly hot to work much.\nFabbri and St\u00e9phanie were there, and we looked at Rubens and Rembrandt. \nWe all lunched together, and again went to Durand-Ruel\u2019s, where Fabbri wobbled up and down about buying a fine Degas, two women yawning. \nAfterwards, Janet and we two went to the Panth\u00e9on and St. Etienne du Mont. \nIn the evening I dined with Alban and Emma, while Bernhard overcame Janet\u2019s objection to going to the Weisser Hirsch.\n \nAs Alban expounded to me his views against dancing, the theatre, billiards, and non-observance of the Sabbath, I felt as if I were a naturalist who had the privilege of observing a live Dodo or Ichth<y>osaurus. \n[p175]\nThis is the list of novels Miss Shedlock\n gave Janet Dodge to read as specimens of the best French literature \u2014 \u2014 !\nGeorge (!)

It turns out that the poor child has been terribly in love with Fafner, who has not behaved well to her. He went to see her every day in Berlin, and told her he was in love with her, but that, by a miracle of heroism and nobility, he would not marry her, on account of his health. At the same time he was saying to his parents, to whom the doctor had said that he ought to marry \u2014 for his health \u2014 and who were urging it on him, that surely they couldn\u2019t want him to fall in love just for that. What he was really up to, though I don\u2019t suppose he was at all fully conscious of it, \n[p177] \nwas simply using her to satisfy his more civilized needs of female companionship, as he used the Berlin shop-girls, with whom he used to make expeditions into the country for a night to satisfy his more brutal needs. It sounds hard to say this, but when Bernhard said to him, Did he never think of the effect on them, in that they might have babies, he seemed never to have thought of it, and so he never thought of what would happen to little Janet. I told her what I thought, and I think it helped to free her from Fafner. She said she had anyhow conquered the feeling \u2014 or rather grown beyond it \u2014 already, but from one or two things I observed I do not think the cure was complete. I hope it is now. I feel almost as tenderly towards her as if she were \u2014 not Ray, but let us say, Ray\u2019s little finger! She is very sincere and very innocent, and I must say it was horrid of Fafner not to have spared her. [two lines crossed out] \n[p178] \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, September 30, 1895\nHotel Morot, Dijon\nPacked and talked and went to see the Besnard in the Pharmacie in the morning. These turned out to be quite as delightful as ever. A Klinger enthusiast ought to adore them! \nAt 2.15 we started for Dijon, reaching this mediocre hotel at 7.30. \nBernard read James\u2019 Psychology and I Flaubert\u2019s awfully witty Bouvard et P\u00e9cuchet. \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, October 1, 1895\nx Hotel d\u2019Angleterre, Lyon\n\u201cDid\u201d Dijon, and came here by an evening train. \nTalking about Renan, I said he was the Pierre Loti of philosophy.\nThe Gallery is a fraud. \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, October 2, 1895, Lyon\n\u201cDid\u201d Lyon. \nThe Gallery here is a fraud too. \nBernhard spent hours over the time-table while I wrote to the Burkes and Janet. \nA long letter to Fafner looms ahead of me. \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, October 3, 1895\nHotel Crillon, Avignon\nWe journeyed from 9.48 till 2.15, I laughing over Bouvard et P\u00e9cuchet and Bernhard reading <William> James and agonizing over time tables. \nAt 2.15 we stopped \n[p179]\nat Orange, and after a quarrel over the Roman Arch, which Bernhard found more solid and grander than I did, we proceeded to be overwhelmed by the imposing fa\u00e7ade of the Theatre. After exhausting that emotion, we ate some fruit, walked out to see a glorious sunset on Mt. Ventoux, smoked, and then took the train here.\n$$HEADER$$_Friday, October 4, 1895, Avignon \nThe thing to do would be to get rooms at the quiet Europe, and eat here, for the restaurant is not bad.\nWe spent a really rapturous day seeing this town and Villeneuve opposite, with its marvellous views. \nThe Galleries are complete frauds, except for a small mask by Laurana.\n\nWe had various letters, one from Perry saying he would send a Mr. Coba to see Bernhard \u2014 \u201cHe is \n[p180] \nnot one who torments his kind.\u201d A foolish letter from Obrist, returning to his id\u00e9e fixe that the Germans have done everything already, and an amusing one from Miss Sellers suggesting that Logan and Miss Lowndes should take a villa at San Miniato and discuss Pater and Montaigne to their hearts\u2019 content, leaving us to wrestle with art on the Fiesolan Mount. \nRay writes from Biarritz that she swims twice a day and is learning to dive.\nA favourable review of Lotto by MacColl has just come out in The Spectator, Sept. 28. \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, October 5, 1895\nx Cheval Blanc, N\u00eemes\nWe came in a morning train from Avignon here, succeeding by a miracle of cunning and ingenuity in skipping the Pont de Gare! \nA man in the train talked to us a great deal about the poet Mistral. \nBernhard said Provence looks upon him as Abraham did on \n[p181]\nSarah, when at her unlikely age she gave birth to Isaac. We found a rather gorgeous cuisine at this hotel, and made a very good lunch.\nThen we saw the pictures in the Mus\u00e9e \u2014 non ragioniam di lor, ma guarda e passa! \u2014 and the exquisite Maison Carr\u00e9e, as well as the churches and the temple of Diana and the Tour Magne, not to speak of the arena which is just opposite this hotel. \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, October 6, 1895\nHotel de la Paix, Beziers \nSaw the horrible gallery at Montpellier, and quarrelled violently over the Baryes,\n Bernhard insisting that they were very fine, I sniffing. \nMade up our quarrel over an early Pesellino\n we both discovered, and nearly tore out our hair with rage because we couldn\u2019t have a ladder to go up and read the signature of a very queer picture.\nWe left Montpellier gladly, and came to this dirtiest of \n[p182]\ntowns, which in spite of its splendid situation is horrible. \nWe hung around the Cathedral and bridges as long as we could, rejoicing in the thought that we need never come here again, for the gallery contains nothing but a Zaganelli and a doubtful, repainted Benozzo.\n\n$$HEADER$$_Monday, October 7, 1895\nx Hotel Chaubard, Toulouse\nWe saw Narbonne and Carcassonne, and immensely enjoyed the latter.\nDined at the Buffet at C. and had a good dinner. \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, October 8, 1895\n* Hotel Groc, Cordes\n\nA picturesque little village on the top of a steep rock. For people who don\u2019t know Italy, well worth seeing. Anyhow, it is \u201creal country\u201d and one enjoys the air and quiet.\nLeft our book-bag in Toulouse!! \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, October 9, 1895\nx Hotel Cassagnes, Albi\nWe got up at half past five \u2014 what a \n[p183]\ndelicious morning! The drive to the station \u2014 Vindrac \u2014 was wonderful in the early sunshine and dew.\nThen Albi! How we have enjoyed not only the Cathedral, but the town from the river all day. \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, October 10, 1895\n* Cheval Blanc, N\u00eemes \nA run around Albi before starting on an all day journey across country \u2014 but beautiful country, and in a slow train one doesn\u2019t mind. It reminded us of the Lucchese.\nThis hotel is not a place for coffee \u2014 one should take it at the caf\u00e9 aside the Theatre, in sight of the Maison Carr\u00e9e. There the coffee is superb! \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, October 11, 1895\nHotel du Forum, Arles, St. R\u00e9my\n has been perhaps our most perfect experience. The blue-grey plain of the Rhone, Cevignac, Mt. Ventoux, the olives and pines, the wind fragrant with lavender and mint, the battered Triumphal Arch and the Monument on a grassy circle enclosed by a little stream \u2014 \n[p184]\ndreams of unsordid life filled with exquisite art-enjoyments, Virgil, Petrarch \u2014 all this and more!! \nThen we drove across to Arles by way of Les Baux, a rocky mountain nest of houses. \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, October 12, 1895\nHotel de la Poste, Marseilles\nWe \u201cdid\u201d Arles, not enjoying it very rapturously (compared to Avignon, Nimes, Albi, Carcassonne and St. R\u00e9my), but we spent an interesting hour or so in the Museum. \nThen we came on here, greatly enjoying the glorious approach to this town. \nIn the Museum we discovered two P. di Cosimos (!!!), and a Cariani.\n We had a horrid dinner at the Maison Dor\u00e9e, got our letters and wrote a little in the evening. \n\n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, October 13, 1895\nHotel du Var, St. Maximin\nSpent the morning at Aix. The Cathedral is not worth a star in Baedeker, though it is certainly interesting archaeologically. \nWe found two Lippo Memmis in the gallery and I (!) discovered a Cordeliaghi\n and a Moretto, while \n[p185]\nBernhard unearthed a Francesco di Cotignola of an unspeakable character. \nWe came here and enjoyed the severe Gothic of this church, and then had an enchanting walk in the fields.\nLife is much enhanced by smoking Flor Farias \u2014 but alas! they are undeniably beyond our means! \nI began to read Nietzsche\u2019s Antichrist. \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, October 14, 1895\nx Les Etrangers, Nice\nA last look at St. Maximin \u2014 as perfect in Gothic as the Maison Carr\u00e9e in Greek \u2014 neat, delicate, unsuperfluous, clean.\nThen the train, arriving here in time to climb the hill for sunset and eat and drink the marvellous air for a couple of hours before dinner. The atmospheric conditions here are such that you really feel your body a perfect instrument of your spirit. \n[p186] \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, October 15, 1895\nRoma, Savona\nIt took us a long, hot, indescribably tiresome journey to get here, and there is only one thing here to see, or smell, or hear. Still the one thing, a fine altar-piece by Foppa, had to be seen, and we have done it. \nOur consciences are at rest, and we shall forget the bad dinner, the dirty town full of squalling brats and discordant brass-bands. \n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, October 16, 1895\nRoma, Savona\nI made a mistake in saying there was only one thing to see in Savona. We went out in the morning and explored the Cathedral, and found some very interesting choir-stalls given by Julius II and executed by some Lombard artist, and, best of all, an altar-piece which revealed to me the authorship of that mysterious Annunciation in the Galerie de Sept M\u00e8tres, namely \n[p187]\nBria di Nizza! \nThen we took the train of endless tunnels and came here, and had a look at the Cathedral before sunset. Beautiful as it is is in colour, and richness of detail, as architecture, it is so much less serious, less intellectual than the French buildings we have seen. It cannot for a moment compare with St. Sernin of Toulouse. Even the marble looks like a coating. It has none of the solidity of Roman or Northern Romanesque building. It does not exist first of all. It begins and ends with ornamentation. \nCuriously, for the first time we noticed the fine old stained glass and the richly carved pillars of the portals of the Cathedral and Baptistery. One needs to go to the same place a dozen times for different things that one\u2019s eye is peeled to! \n[p188]\n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, October 17, 1895\nVilla Rosa, Fiesole \nWe reached home at noon, having found \u201cil Cocchino\u201d waiting for us at the station, and Rosa and Pia, and a good lunch here.\nThe rest of the day was devoted to unpacking and letter-writing, to peeping into the accumulated art-journals and to reading Herrick, which we were not at all in the mood for. \nMichael writes from revisiting the place where they used to live and where Field went to college seven years ago: \n\u201cDoctrine, Doctrine, but I thought, as I maternally watched the brisk little figure with its college satchel and shining morning face across the Downs, well, I thought of one set for \u201cthe fall and rising again of many in Israel\u201d (see Bible!) and the full welling-up (no memory) the full welling-up to heart\u2019s brain of all you have done to \n[p189]\nenrich and impoverish, to lay waste and to build up, to annex and to liberate so wrought into me that, like Jacob of old, I wanted to pause on the spot and erect something. No \u2014more \u2014 I wanted to kill something. I always do when I am intensely grateful, and that ought to be psychologically interesting to you, now that you are looking into the beginnings and sources of desire, especially as I am an excellent type of the normal savage, and have not dropt an element of the motional experience of my forefathers.\u201d\n$$HEADER$$_Friday, October 18, 1895, Fiesole\nSetting in. I was laid up in the afternoon, but Bernhard went down to Florence, had a browse in the Library, etc., and saw Puliga and Fabbri.\nIn the afternoon we read Mrs. Sparmann\u2019s\n astonishingly \u201cstraight\u201d bit of thinking about music, in which she \n[p190]\nstates that motion is the only thing represented, and that all other emotional effects are merely associative. Motion is the Urbild of music, and motion alone.\n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, October 19, 1895, Fiesole\nNietzsche is a Walt Whitman \u00e0 rebours, finding every actual thing vile because of the intensity of life and power he desires. Men seem weak and absurd, and all religions and human institutions contemptible. But for all that, he is an optimist, and immensely inspiring, for his gospel is Life and all that \u201cmakes for Life, energy, power.\u201d \nBernhard began his article on Italian pictures in America\n and I finished Le Vergini delle Rocce,\n etc. in the morning. We drove into Florence and did some errands.\nFabbri came to dinner and we talked about whether great art is popular, starting from the commonplace saying that \u201ctruly great art appeals to all classes of people.\u201d Bernhard held that in the one case where it had been thoroughly tried on great masses of naive people \u2014 the case of Folk Songs and Ballads and the goods \u2014 the goods only had been preserved. \n[p191]\nAnd he contended that there is an almost mechanical connection between good art and the well-being of man \u2014 like food and digestion, which would lead mankind, if free, to choose out and retain the good, as it has done in the main, in food. Only the plastic arts have never been really and freely tried in Europe. Coming from the Greek civilization, which was founded so largely upon the power of the orator \u2014 the power of words \u2014 literature has been the art with us. People who aim at being educated can still afford to say they don\u2019t like music and don\u2019t care for painting, but dare not make the same confession about literature.\nFabbri said the architect of the fa\u00e7ade of the Duomo here made two plans, one with points and one flat, and that they erected one of wood, half the plan on each side, uncovered them, and submitted the decision as to which plan should prevail to vote \u2014 !! It seems too funny to be true.\nWe talked about Ruskin, and the \n[p192]\nfact that his sense for art was almost wholly confined to decoration.\nWe also talked about the \u201crepresentative\u201d side of art. Fabbri said, \u201cNo good work of art can resemble nature.\u201d Bernhard said, \u201cA work of art may be great, even if it resembles nature.\u201d \nA letter from Mrs. Burke says she met her husband in Rotterdam, by chance, and they have made it up!! \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, October 20, 1895\nVilla Rosa, Fiesole \nI wrote up our Provence trip for an article in the morning, and Bernhard worked on his article about the Italian pictures in America. \nNews came from Burke and his wife that they were together, and had decided to make a \u201ctrial marriage\u201d for a while, to see how it would work. I am so glad. I feel sure they will now be happy together. \nIn the afternoon we called on Mrs. Morgan and had a little chat about children\u2019s books, etc., and then I read Nietzsche\u2019s bad-tempered diatribes against Wagner, and Bernhard began Tarde\u2019s Les Lois de l\u2019Imitation.\n A singularly happy, care-free day. \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, October 21, 1895, Fiesole\nWorked until Mr. Hamilton and Carlo Placci came to lunch. Mr. Hamilton said it had been \n[p193]\nsuch a hot dry summer they had run out of water and one day they had to give their horse Miss Paget\u2019s bath to drink. I told Bernhard and Placci, and we all fell into a fit of laughter. As Placci said, it would have been almost a poetical myth, if it had been Diana and Pegasus, but when you visualized that horse and that maiden!\nPlacci stayed and talked all the afternoon. I told him about Mrs. Piper and the Psychical Society and he uttered a real cry from the heart, \u201cO!\u201d, he said, \u201cit would be nice after all to think one was going on living!\u201d We talked of many things, but <he> was most interested in the question of Love, as he seems to be in love himself. He contended that the latest love must always be the one supreme love, but Bernhard said that when a great love had once flooded one\u2019s whole personality \u2014 in so far as it can \u2014 every recess and \n[p194]\nand cave and hollow place, a later love, if it flooded you less would always be subject to the comparison. \nWe took Placci on our rampart walk, but I can\u2019t remember all we talked about. \nIn the evening Bernhard read Le Vergini delle Rocce and I Nietzsche\u2019s G\u00f6tzend\u00e4mmerung. \n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, October 22, 1895\nVilla Rosa, Fiesole \nI read Canto I of the Inferno, and a little Perry in the morning, and then worked. Bernhard read James and worked. \nAfter an early lunch we walked down to Florence, and found only one picture in the Uffizi of classic quality, the Venus \u2014 Botticelli\u2019s, of course. This seems absurd, but it is quite true. And we both came to it without exchanging a word. \nWe did more shopping, and came up in the 6 o\u2019clock tram, and began to correct the first proofs of the Florentine Painters before diner. \nAt dinner I got cross with Bernhard for not talking, and he made an effort and pulled himself out of his blues and talked like a \n[p195]\nreal angel in the evening. He complained of feeling hurried, as if it were incumbent on him to write something that would excuse him for having written the Lotto! This was not the angelic part of his conversation, but I put it down to laugh over. When we really seriously fell into talk it was about the art of literature, especially poetry, which is pure literature, for it is not the medium for conveying instruction. The effect of poetry is attained when it throws you into a Stimmung of the kind that does not lead out into action, intransitive, which is the ideal physical state, one of those moods of bien-\u00eatre, \u201cwhen the mind is free to muse on what delights it most\u201d. Starting from the proposition that all pleasure, whatever its cause, as \n[p196]\npleasure, is physical, the question is what is the peculiar pleasure which poetry can give? and it is this, the awakening of certain divine moods of bien-\u00eatre. A mood of this kind is the equivalent of tactile values in painting. Only when a figure has those can it be said to have artistic existence: only when a poem can throw you into such a mood, do we take it for real and begin to enjoy it as such. Others poems amuse, instruct, elevate or harrow us, but their tale told, their instruction imparted, they cease to exist, while a poem with no particular meaning, like Blake\u2019s \u201cSunflower, weary of time\u201d, will always exist. \nA million poems rush to my mind, and the fine lines in them are always those that bring a distinct physical mood. How incomparably finer than anything else in the \u201cOde to Duty\u201d is the stanza in which the lines occur \n\u201cFlowers laugh before thee in their beds \nand fragrance in thy footing treads \n[p197] \nThou dost preserve the stars from wrong, \nand the most ancient Heavens, through thee are fresh and strong.\u201d\nWhat a sense of eternal youth and infinite security and support!\nEnglish poetry has devoted itself to this, the real problem of poetry, more than that of any other nation.\nThere remains the problem of the sounds of words, just as in painting there remains the problem of colour, and in music the tones.\nTwo English girls in the gallery looking at Leonardo\u2019s Adoration and The Head of Medusa: \u201cBaedeker says it is probably not genuine\u201d and passed on!\n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, October 23, 1895, Fiesole \nA letter to Mother from Mrs. Oscar Wilde, who has changed her name to Holland and is in Switzerland says: \n\u201cI have changed my name, but I am not taking any legal proceedings. My poor misguided husband, who is weak rather than wicked, repents most \n[p198]\nbitterly all his past madness, and I cannot refuse to him the forgiveness he has asked. So I have withdrawn from the Divorce proceedings that I was at one time tempted to institute, or rather that I was worried to institute for the sake of my boys. But the necessity of that is obviated by the Bankruptcy proceedings in which I am claiming through my Trustees the life-interest of my money, which does at present belong to my husband, and which will then go straight to the children after my death. \nI can only trust that I have been guided right, and I have indeed sought Divine Wisdom, but things are so complicated that it is difficult to tell whether one has been guided right. \nI am sure that you will agree with me that where these is repentance, it is not the place of the wife to be Avenger. Just think what he has lost! Practically all that made life bearable to him. I hear from the prison chaplain and from others who have an opportunity of judging that he is very heart-broken, and \n[p199]\nmost especially so with regard to the trouble that he has brought on myself and the boys. \nAffectionately yours,\nConstance Holland\u201d\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nWe worked as usual in the morning, and Fabbri came to lunch. We talked of Nietzsche\u2019s hatred to the religion of Mitleid, and Bernhard said Nietzsche\u2019s ethics was a system suitable for a nomad tribe who would be impeded in their march if half a dozen were ill. He forgot that sympathy and care for the suffering may be also an expression of extra strength, more than enough for one\u2019s own personal ends. Moreover, he seems never to have thought that the self is enlarged by sympathy.\nWe also talked of Mrs. Piper and the next world, and how thoroughly it \n[p200]\nwill be at an end with dogmatic Christianity if the Psychical Society can prove that there is no heaven or hell or Purgatory. The only possible religion will then be a ritual without dogma, something like the American \u201cAnglicanism\u201d which is making such progress there.\nBernhard and Fabbri walked up to the Morgans, and I took the rampart walk, in the rain. \nAfter tea we finished correcting the first part of the proofs of the Florentine Painters, and wrote letters and had a little Matthew Arnold and reading before bed-time. \n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, October 24, 1895\nVilla Rosa, Fiesole \nBernhard to Michael: \u201cI\u2019m at work again, and already finishing up an article on - Good Lord! - Italian pictures in America. \nBut my heart\u2019s in the Highlands, my heart is not here.\n By here the prophet foreshadowed Connoisseurship, of which I\u2019m sick even \n[p201]\nunto nausea. At bottom I no longer care a smart farthing who painted anything, yea, and the archaeological, morphological, even historical talk about pictures is like wicked stench unto my almighty nostrils. The letter A in art would now have to wear a countless number of superimposed tiaras to convey a conception of the mysticity and awe with which I now regard art. I think hard, but unbeknownst, so to speak, even to myself. \nThe problem before me is simple: Granting that the pleasure element is always sensuous, as we must grant, what is the specific element of sensuous pleasure in each of the arts? I am thinking about all the arts this time, not painting alone. The answer to these questions will be contained in my next big book, if ever it gets written. Meanwhile the small book on the \n[p202]\nFlorentine Painters will be like a voice gone out of Fiesole urbi et orbi, telling what the element of pleasure is in figure painting; and sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof, you will say when you peruse it. \nWe are reading D\u2019Annunzio\u2019s Virgins of the Rocks, which, though prose, has the cadence and rhythm of Virgil\u2019s divinest verse. It breathes myrrh and frankincense, which the new Magi have just brought to this latest born but not least in the kingdom of Judah.\nPsychology is more and more absorbing me. Tell Field that as she loves me and herself I urge her to get the large edition of James\u2019 Psychology and to read it diligently. Great shall be the fruit thereof. We are now of man\u2019s estate, and lo! it is time to put off childish things.\nI have re-read Madame Bovary recently. I was overawed by its greatness. It ought to go into the Bible, the Bible up to date, bien entendu, after the Book of Ruth. \nI am now reading Bouvard et P\u00e9cuchet, which unfinished and ever prosaic \n[p203]\nand unlicked as it is, I find epic in quality. It is Homer this time really writing. Batryomyomachia, but what a masterpiece! O ye dwellers in Philistia, think ye it is so easy to leap over the boundary and to enter the gates of the Olympian Jerusalem, read, and you will see that it is easier for a camel to pass through a needle.\u201d\nWe worked as usual in the morning. I began an article for the Chronique on the Italian pictures in the South of France Galleries, of which I finished the rough draft in the evening.\nIt was raining, but as it let up about 3 we went out for a walk round by Vincigliata, but got caught in a torrent on the way home. \nI read Klinger\u2019s brochure on Malerei und Zeichnung, and Bernhard went on with Tarde\u2019s Lois de l\u2019Imitation. We also read German poetry. \n[p204] \nA letter from Janet Dodge, in which she says that the Berliners are very \u201csniffy\u201d about new composers, and French composers \u00fcberhaupt.\n\u201cIt is all on a par with what my Composition teacher, Prof. Bongiel, said to me one day, that it was much more instructive to stay at home of an evening and do one\u2019s Theorie than to go to hear \u2018such things\u2019 as the Berlioz\u2019 Requiem (which I had heard the night before).\u201d !!! \nA nice letter from HO says that he found Mrs. Burke \u201cuninteresting to a nearly interesting degree \u2026 a temperament of porcelain. Fr\u00e4ulein Augspurg said: that woman has an oil skin on her heart. She\u2019ll keep dry and cool and hard \u2026\u201d\nAt Stuttgart I looked for more than an hour at 2 reproductions of B\u00f6cklin, Der Eroberer Vestalinnenopfer.\n You are right, 2700 times right, that the essentially artistic element is tactile values, movement, etc. Of course you are right. In these pictures, however, there are no tactile values even to speak of, no movement in our decorative \n[p205]\nas running header: \u2018Letter from HO\u2019\nsense of the word. Nulla. The whole Ergriffenheit that I am in, have been in, will be in looking at these pictures comes purely and only from the representative element, the powerful Stimmung of the tale told, i.e., nach Herren B.B. illustration pure and simple. \nThat Eroberer excites my fancy, suggests flights of vision of all that brooding man will still do on that desert island, and no literature, no Byron and no Browning, has ever succeeded to stimulate my visual and emotional fancy a tenth part like B\u00f6cklin or Klinger. If these last are po\u00e8tes manqu\u00e9s, they are manqu\u00e9s towards the + and not towards the -. If you are keenly sure of your sensations, your tactile prehensibility, your salivatiousness, etc., so am I about my fancy-sensations and their intense enjoyment.\nIf I hint at these subjects, it is not because I think it of any use whatsoever, but only cos\u00ec en passant. You have so made up your mind about the representative element having nothing to do with the bildende K\u00fcnste, you are or were \n[p206] \nas running header: \u2018Letter from HO\u2019\nso dead set against it, that I can only let the tooth of time gnaw at you, refraining from scratching myself. D\u00fcrer\u2019s Malinconia, his Ritter, Tod und Teufel, contain of course the essentially artistic qualities of tactile values, movement, etc. But das ergreifende dran is that what D\u00fcrer means to express intellectually, emotional, symbolically.\nThe suggestive Stimmung\nYou, as B.B., are so organized that you care en dernier lieu for tactile values, etc. (which makes you prefer Stauffer Bern to Klinger) and I am so organized that quite en dernier lieu I prefer the other. If that other is \u2018poetry, literature\u2019, why the devil don\u2019t I adore Keats, Shelley?\u201d\nThe answer is that each art must have that element which makes me take it as real before I can find in it the inexhaustibility of reality, and be affected by it lastingly.\nWhat is that element in each of the arts? \n[p207] \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, October 25, 1895\nVilla Rosa, Fiesole\nA day with little to record, as we worked over the proofs of the Florentine Painters. \nWe went down to the Academy in the afternoon, and spent an hour in the Library, reading the Giornali.\nWe discovered Michelangelo\u2019s S. Matteo!!!\n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, October 26, 1895\nAgain the damed Proofs, and a run into Florence to get the number of a Pollaiuolo. \nWe meet Miss Hertz and a friend of hers in the Uffizi. Miss Hertz made us think of nothing but Bouvard,\n except possibly Aunty Lill!\nBernhard then called on La baronne Puliga (\u201cBrada\u201d) and on Benn, while I walked home and devoted myself to some deadly dull writing on the French provincial galleries. \nAll the evening we corrected, and corrected, and corrected proofs, until nearly 11, when we read Bernhard\u2019s article on the Italians in New York and Boston. \n[p208] \n$$HEADER$$_Sunday, October 27, 1895, Fiesole \nWe corrected all the rest of the proofs, a terrible task! \nAlso I sent off to the Chronique my articles on provincial galleries, and Bernhard sent his article to the Gazette on Italians in New York and Boston.\nWe read part of Galton\u2019s Men of Science together.\nIt was raining almost continuously, but we snatched a short walk about 5. We have enjoyed this quiet day very much. \nViola, Bernhard\u2019s servant, came over for some butter this morning and called at the gate for twenty minutes, and then went back, saying no one heard her to let her in. \u201cNon ha suonato?\u201d \u201cMa no, Signora, non ho pensato di suonare.\u201d She is really next door to a machine. So then she came back and rang, and was let in.\n\n$$HEADER$$_Monday, October 28, 1895, Fiesole\nFinished the Putnam business matters and went down to lunch at the Placcis. He told us of Lord Onslow, who had let his place. The tenant \n[p209]\nafter a time cried off the bargain, because, he said, the place was haunted. Lord Onslow would not admit the ghost, but after a while came with 3 friends to investigate. They all saw it, and even fired a shot which passed right through the figure. He then let the tenant off his contract. I shall try to find out what is the truth of this! \n A painter, Conte Bosco of Bologna, came in and spoke of the Venetian Exhibition. Fra Giacomo he praised as a master of sea painting. But he was wildly enthusiastic about what he called the \u201cart\u201d of that horrible affair by Grasso. There, he said, was a man who could do what he could not, who possessed extreme technical ability. Placcci objected that the thing was in bad taste, and hideous. \u201cO you never tried to draw the nude\u201d was the reply. In short, a complete painter\u2019s criticism. \nThen we three went to the Palazzo Gino Capponi and saw the picture of \n[p210]\nhis son-in-law, the Marchese Farinola, a small Last Communion of St. Jerome by Botticelli, a little gem, almost among his best. Placci could thoroughly enjoy the purely decorative part, the bed covered with sheepskin and the crucifix and palms and cedars above it, and the matting roof and walls, but the representative element distressed him. Instead of getting abstract values of motion, he felt like a feeble old man, or a young priest or acolyte holding up a heavy body or candles. So we went to the Primavera, and there again the representative elements distressed him, the blueness of the figure to the right, the flowers coming out of the woman\u2019s mouth, etc. But he began to see, after a while, the marvellous pattern of space and lines weaving in and out.\nWe went to look at the back of the Duomo, and then came home and had tea and a divine hour listening to him and to Buonamici playing Wagner\u2019s Siegfried Idyll, the Hundigung March,\n and Humperdinck\u2019s Hansel and Grethel.\nA walk home by moonlight, a good dinner, unpacking new books, reading \u2014 and so ended a nice day. \n[p211] \nLetter from Michael \nMichael writes (to me) one of two fine sentences: \u201cNow I envy you (my envy is only Bunyan\u2019s when he saw the pilgrims\u2019 jolly in heaven \u2014 which, when I beheld, I wished myself among them \u2014 not in the least a desire to put a serpent in their midst) settling down to your hills and winter plain, double your share of stars by night, and such an amplitude of coloured air by day I \u2014 we \u2014 find with years that the eye needs a few quite simple outlines \u2014 and the mind \u2014 how few books. The mind learns the secret, St. Francis\u2019 secret, of holy poverty, and trips the world blithely without a sous.\u201d \nShe also quotes from Coleridge\u2019s letters: \u201cthe folly of sinning against our first and pure impressions! It is the sin against our own ghost at least.\u201d\n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, October 29, 1895, Fiesole\nQuiet day of work. \nColnaghi\u2019s partner came to see Bernhard on business, and he also had a long walk with Mr. Benn. \nI went to town to shop. I read one of Placci\u2019s stories (printed in the Illustrazione) but alas! did not like it in any way. \n[p212] \nLetter to HO\n\u2026\u201d\n B\u00f6cklin and Klinger arouse your fancy, they suggest flights of visions, etc., etc. Why, you ask, are they not Art? It is our old contention, and you do not seriously intend me to go over all the arguments once more? Still for a moment I will linger over this. Is it not time \u2014 please be accurately introspective here \u2014 that first you feel a cerebral activity, and then and then only something approaching, yet only vaguely, I think, the condition of definite bien-\u00eatre. But this sort of thing is not at all artistic. It happens to every man over any matter that rouses his cerebral activity in a satisfactory way, and consequently the surgeon speaks of a beautiful cancer, the mathematician of a beautiful problem, etc. The \u2018beautiful\u2019 so used \u2014 your use also \u2014 is only a sign of gratitude to a something that has started your cerebration. You personally perhaps have a poor visual memory, and a consequently poor constructive, i.e., illustrating, fancy. \n[p213] \n\u201cPoetry therefore of the highest (you say, but I believe it is in part due to your not understanding it) \u2014 poetry, you say, never rouses your fancy as B\u00f6cklin and Klinger. Poetry rouses my fancy far more, because I have a lively visual imagination so easily that I generally almost unconsciously visualize every phrase I read, and in a way which makes even the best illustration seem tame. Illustration, as such, has therefore but slight value to me, and would have even less if I were an artist, a person whose cerebration had to take the form of visual reconstruction. Your cerebration has to take that form, and you prize whatever stimulates it in you. But at the same rate you would be justified in having illusions about a wench who stimulated your sexual appetite, or, to be more serious, any person who made you talk. It is a notorious fact that the people who have the most to say themselves are rarely the ones to make you talk best. That happens once in a great while, but generally <a> sane person you recognize as a \n[p214] \nLetter to HO\n\u201c decided inferior does that much better. I hope you understand my addlepated lingo, but my point is that art has not to do with the stimulation of our most absorbing activities, bur rather to put us into that physical condition which makes us say to a moment, \u201cStay, thou art so fair\u201d. In other words, to supply the baro-hygro-thermo-metric conditions to the merely visual effect. If a man can put us into these desired conditions, he is an artist already \u2014 a life-giver, a creator in the highest sense of the word. If he can not only put us into these wonderful conditions, but, while we are in that enchanting mood, present us with great ideas, tant mieux. But remember that ideas will seem so marvellous because we were in such a marvellous condition when we received them, and because in the work of art they have been made insoluble.\nWith our usual carelessness about subjective states, unless we are extremely acute in analysis, we jump over to the representation pure and simple, and regard that as the cause of our ecstasy. On the \n[p215] \nLetter to HO\ncontrary! it is the condition that made us feel the idea. You could not have chosen better illustrations than your examples of the Malinconia and the Ritter. The boundless energy of the line and touch keys you up to a condition wherein anything would seem wonderful, and of course D\u00fcrer had more than mediocre ideas: still, as mere ideas, these engravings are not overwhelming. Their inexhaustibility comes not from their intellectuality but from their powerful tonic effect. \nIt is this, it is this which makes art, and nothing else. One of the most heart-rending mistakes humanity has ever made is the belief that art means no more than to supply phrases with visual accompaniments, or, in other words, ideas with representations of the things they stand for. That (which is all that 99 per cent of even intelligent humanity means by the plastic and figure arts) is no more art than any other form of translation. Translation it is, pure and simple. \nHence, by the way, the rotten but logical talk about art being the translation of something, into the material of something else, and the placing \n[p216]\nof this idiotic statement in the fundamental principle of art\u2026\u201d\nJanet, in a letter, speaks of the \u201cdelight of hearing or seeing a work of art which one knows nothing about beforehand \u2014 that beautiful feeling of uncertainty and swaying and final surrender.\u201d \n*     *\n *\n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, October 31, 1895, Fiesole \n[p217]\nWe also talked about D\u2019Annunzio and Marius (Pater) and Virgil. The Inhalt of D\u2019Annunzio, the lack of universality, of high seriousness prevents the book being a classic. He is too eager to express himself, to burst out into words. He expresses no ethical attitude toward life in a large sense.\nPlacci asked me what I was at work on. \u201cStruggling to express second-hand ideas in my Louvre guide-book,\u201d I said. If I could always be as truthful! \nIn the evening Bernhard and I read over the correspondence between Obrist and myself up to my going to Munich. I must confess, it was much duller than I thought it would be. It bored us to death. Besides this, it was obviously hollow and not ingenuous. The \u2026\n[p218] \n$$HEADER$$_Friday, Nov. 1, 1895, Fiesole\nMiss Hertz and her unendurable friend came to tea, and discoursed upon art until we almost got apoplexy from holding in our rage. \nThen Mr. Holroyd, an English artist whom Bernhard knew years ago, came to dinner. He has a great deal of interest in Italian art, and all he said was pretty sane and eminently intelligent. It was an evening of quiet recognition, so to speak, of the fact that another had reached many of the same points of view we had ourselves attained. \n$$HEADER$$_Saturday, Nov. 2, 1895\nMr. Holroyd and his wife and little boy of 3 came to spend the day. The wife is a faded edition of her husband\u2019s ideas, considerably preoccupied with the child, Michael. Such a woman, like Mrs. Kerr-Lawson also, makes me most unhappy. They have intelligence, too, but as social and intellectual beings they are simply non-existent. Am I as bad as they, I wonder? \n\n[p219] \n$$HEADER$$_Monday, November 4, 1895, Fiesole\nTalk at lunch about the hanging of galleries. The bottom appeal of good art is to a complex of physical sensations whose result is definite or indefinite bien-\u00eatre. Hanging a bad thing by a good one annuls this effect, like an emetic in the midst of a wholesome dinner. Galleries should not be hung to enable a few connoisseurs to make easy confronti. \nWe went down to the Library, walking down and up. \nTold Maud at dinner about Mrs. Piper, and she became an easy and delighted convert. Art pleasures \u2014 the feeling of the physical pleasure without the actual objective stimulus \u2014 offers a splendid analogy to the \u2026\n\n[p220] \nAt lunch we fell to talking about the study of Greek literature, and how, like Kunstkenners, the critics still keep writing about purely irrelevant matters \u2014 the history, etc. \nBernhard then delivered himself of a small lecture on the subject, the substance of which was as follows: The origin of the modern study of Greek and Roman literature was not the desire to enjoy a beautiful thing, but the hope of finding out, by means of literature, the way to more culture and more life than had been common in the retreating Middle Ages. They did not regard it as an art, or even as a grammar \u2014 still less as philology! \u2014 but only as the thing which contained the secret of a fine way of living. It was, in fact, merely a study of documents revealing the life and temper of the Greeks as a model to imitate. But first, in order to reach these documents, they had to master the Greek \n[p221] \nGrammar. When they found out that the life could not be imitated, then all their enthusiasm, their \u00e9lan of passionate interest, went into grammar and archaeology \u2014 where it has remained ever since. Perry, in working out the formal development of Greek literature, and connecting it with psychology even, has gone a step ahead of the mere grammatical and political interest. But of course he is no nearer the point than Morelli or Berenson in The Venetian Painters!!\n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, November 6, 1895, Fiesole\nWe both went in to Florence in the morning and read M\u00fcntz\n and Cavalcaselle \n[p222]\non Raphael at the Library, etc. \nLoeser came to lunch and was rather nice, unusually so. \nWe all three took a long walk in the afternoon, and read the papers and Havelock Ellis\u2019 Man and Woman\n in the evening. \nBernhard spoke of someone as \u201cirradiating pins and needles.\u201d\n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, November 7, 1895, Fiesole\nLogan\u2019s book, A Youth of Parnassus, came this morning, and also a favourable review of it in Le Temps.\nMichael writes disapproving of the decision the Burkes have come to: \n\u201cIt would be better surely when the wild oats, rather, the tares, or bad stuff in the Scriptural sense, have been sown, to wait at least until the vile crop has been reaped, before considering the field as good ground. But there! Life will look to it. Vengeance is hers, so Michael puts by his spear with a sigh.\u201d\nAnd so might it be said of me. The vile things are not reaped \u2014 alas! It is no use \n[p223]\nmy considering myself good ground. I am not. I am utterly and entirely beaten and discouraged. Reading the last of those horrible letters has broken me. Bernhard was very, very angry, and hated me bitterly for many moments together.\nThere seems to be nothing left to start fresh with \u2014 nothing. At 31 to have been like that, and with such chances for better things. Up to now I hardly could feel that I had done it. I, myself, seemed so different. Now I feel that it was myself and no other \u2014 myself, the person I have to live with, cannot escape from \u2026 \nTo be a person who is fickle in soul, to have loved once, as I really loved Bernhard, and then to waver, to be unable to hold fast the good thing. So selfish, too \u2014 not to think of the pain to him \u2014 and yet he should be my first thought, \n[p224]\nas I know I am always his. \nWhen I left B.F.C.C. I thought my love for Bernhard was forever. It was the only thing that justified my breaking up things. \nAnd then I couldn\u2019t hold firm, but yielded to the delight of feelings that sprang up \u2014 for it is wonderful to be in love. I am glad at least it has been stopped in time for me not to go all to pieces. \nAnd yet if it had been Bernhard, should I have blamed him? Sometimes I think not, for Love in whatever form it comes is a God, and even if it destroys all one\u2019s so-called \u2018moral nature\u2019 it remakes the world \u201cnearer to the heart\u2019s desire\u201d. Why should we put \n[p225]\nfaithfulness above it? \nBut I must not think in this way. It is my wickedness trying to make excuses for my unkind, miserable conduct. ",

He has evolved an interesting idea about landscape, that, until lately, its visual properties were less noticed that its smell, breezes, airiness, etc. That explains plein air just appearing, etc. \nRicketts and Shannon sent me their \u201coccasional publication\u201d, {The Dial|3006|periodical}. Its illustrations {Bernhard|1002|person} said were the progeny resulting from incest between Burne-Jones and \n[p11] \nRossetti. Its prose may be called the bastard of Meredith. In fact, it nearly drove me crazy! \n<BLOCKBREAK/>\n$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, Feb. 20, 1894, {Florence|2001|city} \nI took {Mr. and Mrs. Hapgood|1006|group} to the {Bargello|2009|museum}. She seemed to enjoy it, but he, like \u201c{Vernon Lee|1003|person}\u201d, was ever hastening on to try to get something out of the next thing which the last had failed to give him.\nAfter lunch we went to {Alinari|3025|business}\u2019s to look at photos, and I hired a piano and got Gluck\u2019s Orfeo as a ginning. I enjoyed reading it over. \nWe found some enchanting tea-cakes, enchanting! \n{Emily Dawson|1004|person} came at 7, and she and I dined together at Cesare\u2019s.\n{Bernhard|1002|person} dined at the Luna, and went to call on the Forbes. \nIt has turned excessively cold. \n[p12] \n<BLOCKBREAK/>\n$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, Feb. 21, 1894, {Florence|2001|city}\nCalled on {Bernhard|1002|person} after breakfast, and then took {Emily|1004|person} to see the {Botticellis|1012|person} in the {Uffizi|2008|museum}. \nAfter lunch, we went to the {Marucelliana Library|2010|library} and got Landini\u2019s Commentary on {Botticelli|1012|person}, illustrated with wood-cuts by some close follower. We thought they were {Botticelli|1012|person}, and were awfully disappointed, but tried to see beauties. {Pater|1010|person} evidently did the same. \nI called on Mrs. Hapgood later, and then we talked and looked at photos. I had a neuralgic headache all day. \n{Bernhard|1002|person} dined with {Vernon Lee|1003|person}, who talked to him about his book. She wants him to write upon \u201cThe Work of Art\u201d in the abstract, and he wants to write a book upon the Science of Art Criticism.\n<BLOCKBREAK/>\n$$HEADER$$_Thursday, Feb. 22, 1894\nWent to see the real {Botticellis|1012|person} at the {Marucelliana|2010|library} and enjoyed them rapturously.\nIn the afternoon {Emily|1004|person} and I went to the {Certosa|2011|monastery} and {Bernhard|1002|person} took a last walk with Fletcher, who is going to {Rome|3026|city}.\nWe came back by {San Miniato|2012|monastery} and enjoyed the view.\n{Bernhard|1002|person} came in in the evening and said all the arts, except music, are primarily occupied with space composition, even poetry. I \n[p13] \nlay awake half the night trying to refute it. <marked with a blue line in the left margin>\n<BLOCKBREAK/>\n$$HEADER$$_Friday, Feb. 23, 1894 \nMother and father and A"
