Sacristan most grumpy - pulled curtain over pictures and found it incredible that anyone should \n[074]\n\nwant to look at a picture a whole quarter of an hour. Marched uneasily up and down asking, \u201cEst-ce fini?\u201d Read Baedeker in train. Hist. Holland, Rise of Flemish and Dutch art.\n\nSunday, Aug. 9. 91.

Saw Rembrandt\u2019s Presentation in Temple.\nxxx Vanmeer [sic] von Delft, water and houses.\nPaul Potter - Bull. This is a wonderful picture, painted to be the exact texture of the skin of the different animals. [075] A paradox in paint, for, although it is exactly like, the effect is not at all as we see it. P. P. died before 30. Interesting speculation as to what he might have become, with this wonderful skill with the brush. Saw Italian pictures.\nMonday August 10. 1891. s\u2019Gravenhage\nWent to Museum. Sketched Sodoma - saw other pictures, especially Van Meer van Delft.\nWent to Leyden. Walked about the town. Saw, after infinite difficulty, about a dozen sketch-books of Hokusai. Bought Motley\u2019s Dutch Republicand read introduction. Dined at the restaurant Van Pijl. 4 francs. Very good. Took notes and discussed Motley in evening.\nRead La Princesse Maleine by Maeterlinck of Bruxelles.\n\n[076]\n\nTuesday Aug. 11. 91. s\u2019Gravenhage\nRead Motley while dressing, Goncourt at Breakfast. Went to Museum and \nsketched Sodoma again. Went to Delft. Saw Renaissance Staathuis and Church\n with Renaissance tomb of William of Nassau. Compared it with tomb in \nSalisbury Cathedral. Saw some quaint old houses. Looked for view which Vanmeer \npainted, but didn\u2019t find it. Liked the town of the Groote Kerk. Evening strangely \nblue and violet. Read Motley.\n\n[077] Wednesday. Aug. 12. 91. Amsterdam.\nCame from The Hague here. Read Motley. Went to Museum. Saw \u201cNight Watch\u201d B. B. said it was a poet\u2019s attempt to translate a commonplace subject into verse, and that it was told better and more appropriately, on the whole, in the good prose of Van du Helst, Jardin, etc. Saw a Vermeer von Delft and other Rembrandts and Franz Hals. Very tired. Read more Motley. Walked in Kalverstraat. Discussed the ways of writing history, epic and documental.\n\nThursday. Aug. 13.  91. Amsterdam\nWent to Rijks Museum and saw Rembrandt Old Woman -Syndics - Night Watch. Franz Hals, Portraits and Regents piece, Van du Meer. Van du Helst. Pieter de Hooghe, Van du Meer. Jan Steen.\n[078] Paul Potter, etc. Scoorel. Saw a wonderful majolica plate, with a round representation of a scene somewhat similar to Botticelli\u2019s \u201cCalumny\u201d. Very Timote-esque. The coat of arms was like this:[drawing]\nLunched at Krasnapolski\u2019s - good coffee. Went to the Six gallery (Heerengracht 511) and saw two Vanmeer van Delft\u2019s - a woman pouring out water, and a street scene. This makes 11 of his pictures which B. has seen, e. g., 1 at the Hague, \n\n[0079]\n1 in the Rijks Museum here, 2 in the Six Collection (4), 2 at Dresden (6), 1 at Berlin (7), 1 at Frankfurt (8), 1 in Vienna (9), 1 in the Borghese (10), 1 in the Louvre (11).\nA wonderful Rembrandt (portrait of Burgomaster Six) done very much in Franz Hals manner. A splendid Franz Hals portrait of a man. Some Cuyps, Terborgs, Jan Steens, etc. A large Paul Potter, man on horseback, and a small one of cows.\nRead Motley and de Goncourt. Enjoyed the Palace. Dutch Renaissance, very harmonious and nice. Studied German. Wrote letters. Sent \u201cMaleine\u201dto Miss Bradley and Miss Cooper.\n\n[080] Friday August 14. 1891.\nRead Motley going to Haarlem. Spent 2 1/2 hours in the Museum, studying Frans Hals, etc. We were perfectly fascinated with the two pictures nos. 77 & 78, painted in 1664- in a manner suggestive of Zorn and Carri\u00e8re, but even more modern than either! Compared him to Shakespeare. Also found figures and treatment which Rembrandt must have copied.\nThe best Terburg - a Family Group - was painted very much like a Courtois. A landscape by Van der Velde was like a Hampstead Heath scene by Constable - but better! The Cornelius van Haarlems were all [081] interesting, and the pictures by Jan de Braij, while under Frans Hals\u2019 influence, were very good. A Regents picture by Pot was also extremely good, and some portraits by Verspronck. \nCompared evolution of Hals to Velasquez, beginning where Titian left off.\nWent to Fodor Museum - an absolute fraud, 1 small Meissonier and a slight sketch \nby Watteau.\n Walked through Ghetto.\nSaturday Aug. 15. 91.\nA day in train from Amsterdam 9. 30 to Hanover 8. 50. Missed connections. Very hot and somewhat dusty.\nRead Motley all day and studied German.\n[082] Sunday August 16. 1891. Brunswick\n\nCame from Hanover -studied German in train and began Tolstoi\u2019s \u201cWandelt im Licht.\u201dGallery closed. Saw town and churches and very nice recent buildings in Renaissance style, i. e. - new Schloss, Theater, Police Court, etc. In the Dom the tomb of Henry the Lion and Matilda his wife (done about 1200) was very remarkable and beautiful. Her face was particularly lovely, and as well modelled as anything Greek!! Found it hard to understand.\nAt breakfast discussed the advantages, to a writer, of having no traditions to contend with - compared Dumas fils and Ibsen. Tolstoi and the Russian novelists with the Americans. Also the skill the rich get in objects of [083] household art, such as furniture, tapestry, carpets, etc., but the rarity of their becoming connoisseurs in the higher arts. Goncourt puts it perfectly in his entry for samedi, 20 f\u00e9vrier 1875 \u201cLes gens riches, il leur arrive parfois d\u2019avoir du go\u00fbt dans les porcelaines, dans les tapisseries, dans les meubles, dans les tabati\u00e8res, dans les objets d\u2019art industriel \u2026 il semble vraiment qu\u2019aux richaios, sauf de tr\u00e8s rares exceptions, est d\u00e9fendu le go\u00fbt de l\u2019art sup\u00e9rieur, - de l\u2019art fait par les mains, qui ne sont plus des mains d\u2019ouvrier.\u201d\nThis is especially true of Americans, who really furnish their houses perfectly. However, they as buy good French pictures, or perhaps it is that they buy French pictures, and therefore can\u2019t help getting good ones.\n\n[in Bernhard\u2019s hand]\n[084] Monday August 17. 9\nWent to the gallery in the forenoon, and found that a hail-storm a month ago had smashed the glass-roofs of the large halls, and that the pictures in them therefore were invisible. But we told the custodian we must see them even in the dark. He took us on tiptoe to the Palma, and left us at our request. As we were going out we bumped against two officials. Mutual surprise. They tried to be indignant, then assured us we had risked our lives, because glass was still falling from the roofs. Told them they must know well that when you [0087] come on purpose to see pictures you did not mind risking your life. That disarmed them, and the younger was liebensw\u00fcrdig enough to offer to take us through those same halls with a lantern.\nIn this way we had a glimpse of two pictures that change one\u2019s idea of their painter. One is a portrait by Rubens painted with almost the readiness, and sweat of Frans Hals. Furthermore, it is the only portrait by Rubens I have seen in which Rubens sinks himself. The other picture is Stien\u2019s Wedding-Contract. The bride [088] and bride groom are charming beyond words.\nOther things never to be forgotten are the Vermeer and some of the Rembrandts.\nThe Vermeer had that wonderful purity and tenderness of colouring which makes his work seem so much like the finest porcelain. In this as in the other pictures, the same light blue, the same tints of sage and pea green, and the same effects of atmosphere.\nThe most fascinating Rembrandt is the landscape. One would like to know where he got such a landscape. It is a scene for some strange mysterious tale in Stevenson\u2019s best fashion. Scarcely [089] less impressive is Christ and the Magdalen, neatly and clearly done, but treated in a wonderfully, religious way. The figure of Christ at any rate is full of that humility, and sense of wonder at his own self that Rembrandt more than once gives to the face and form of Jesus. The Magdalen is a Dutch woman of Rembrandt\u2019s own time. Very interesting also are two portraits of Rembrandt\u2019s earliest days, one of Hugo Grotius, a clean, fresh bit of painting, and one of Grotius\u2019 wife. Her portrait we should scarcely have known for [090] a Rembrandt. It is so firm and free from effects of atmosphere.\nFinally I shall scarcely forget a little landscape by the elder Vermeer, a thing severe, quiet, with plenty of sky and spaciousness.\nIn the afternoon we were in the fast express to Berlin, reading Motley and studying German as we rushed thro\u2019 the pretty towns, or past woods of white birch.\n[0087-0088: small notes written by Bernhard \u2028using a fountain pen with an Italic nib]\n[recto 0087]\nSome people answer as if they were shutting the door with a bang.\nMothers \u2026\n[verso 0088]\nPrimavera. Venus-type of Judith and Fortezza, keys left hand as in latter. Mercury and all flesh tints as in Sebastiano of Berlin.\nDrapery of Venus breasts and sleeves as in Judith.\nWith this goes well the Madonna with six saints; in the hands are same.\nMichael and John Polagologos.\n\nFeminine saint of type of 3 dancing women. This is on way to coronation in the landscape as in Venus of ____.\n[in left margin] Spirit same ____ as child in Madonna with 6 saints.\n[from here on in Mary\u2019s hand]\n[090] Tuesday Aug. 18. 91. Berlin\nBreakfast at Bauer\u2019s restaurant.\nWent to Gallery - - - - - - - - - - ! ! 10-3.\nWalked in Thiergarten. Read Layard, etc., in the evening.\n",
