Is it due to the hold of the {Catholic Church|003|institution} in {Belgium|004|country}?  \nRead \u201cL\u2019Intruse\u201d by {Maeterlinck|005|person},and compared it with {Mrs. Augusta Webster|006|person}\u2019s \u201cAuspicious Day.\u201d\n\nAug. 8 Antwerp The Hague 1891  \nRead Vol. V of Journal de {J. Goncourt|007|person} at breakfast. Went to {Mus\u00e9e|008|institution} and saw {Titian|009|person} and {Rubens|010|person} and {Flemings|011|ethnic group}. Sketched ears. After lunch went to the {Cathedral|012|place} to see {Rubens|010|person} and to {S. Jacques|013|place}, where there is a finer {Rubens|010|person}. Sacristan most grumpy - pulled curtain over pictures and found it incredible that anyone should  \n[074]  \n\nwant to look at a picture a whole quarter of an hour. Marched uneasily up and down asking, \u201cEst-ce fini?\u201d Read {Baedeker|014|person} in train.

This is a wonderful picture, painted to be the exact texture of the skin of the different animals. [075] A paradox in paint, for, although it is exactly like, the effect is not at all as we see it. {P. P.|028|person} died before 30. Interesting speculation as to what he might have become, with this wonderful skill with the brush. Saw Italian pictures.  \nMonday August 10. 1891. s\u2019Gravenhage  \nWent to {Museum|025|institution}. Sketched {Sodoma|030|person} - saw other pictures, especially {Van Meer van Delft|027|person}.  \nWent to {Leyden|031|city}. Walked about the town. Saw, after infinite difficulty, about a dozen sketch-books of {Hokusai|032|person}. Bought {Motley|033|person}\u2019s {Dutch Republic|034|book}.and read introduction. Dined at the restaurant {Van Pijl|035|restaurant}. 4 francs. Very good. Took notes and discussed {Motley|033|person} in evening.  \nRead {La Princesse Maleine|036|literary work (concept)} by {Maeterlinck|005|person} of {Bruxelles|037|city}.\n\n[076]  \n\nTuesday Aug. 11. 91. s\u2019Gravenhage  \nRead {Motley|033|person} while dressing, {Goncourt|007|person} at Breakfast. Went to {Museum|025|institution} and  \nsketched {Sodoma|030|person} again. Went to {Delft|038|city}. Saw Renaissance {Staathuis|039|building} and {Church|040|place}  \nwith Renaissance tomb of {William of Nassau|041|person}. Compared it with tomb in  \n{Salisbury Cathedral|042|place}. Saw some quaint old houses. Looked for view which {Vanmeer|027|person}  \npainted, but didn\u2019t find it. Liked the town of the {Groote Kerk|043|place}. Evening strangely  \nblue and violet. Read {Motley|033|person}.\n\n[077] Wednesday. Aug. 12. 91. {Amsterdam|044|city}.  \nCame from The Hague here. Read {Motley|033|person}. Went to {Museum|025|institution}. Saw \u201c{Night Watch|045|artwork (concept)}\u201d {B. B.|046|person} said it was a poet\u2019s attempt to translate a commonplace subject into verse, and that it was told better and more appropriately, on the whole, in the good prose of {Van du Helst|047|person}, {Jardin|048|person}, etc. Saw a {Vermeer von Delft|027|person} and other {Rembrandts|019|person} and {Franz Hals|024|person}. Very tired. Read more {Motley|033|person}. Walked in {Kalverstraat|049|street}. Discussed the ways of writing history, epic and documental.\n\nThursday. Aug. 13.  91. {Amsterdam|044|city}  \nWent to {Rijks Museum|050|institution} and saw {Rembrandt|019|person} {Old Woman|051|artwork (concept)} -{Syndics|052|artwork (concept)} - {Night Watch|045|artwork (concept)}. {Franz Hals|024|person}, {Portraits|053|artwork (concept)} and {Regents piece|054|artwork (concept)}, {Van du Meer|027|person}. {Van du Helst|047|person}. {Pieter de Hooghe|055|person}, {Van du Meer|027|person}. {Jan Steen|021|person}.  \n[078] {Paul Potter|028|person}, etc. {Scoorel|056|person}. Saw a wonderful majolica plate, with a round representation of a scene somewhat similar to {Botticelli|057|person}\u2019s \u201c{Calumny|058|artwork (concept)}\u201d. Very Timote-esque. The coat of arms was like this:[drawing]  \nLunched at {Krasnapolski\u2019s|059|restaurant} - good coffee. Went to the {Six gallery|060|institution} ({Heerengracht 511|061|address}) and saw two {Vanmeer van Delft|027|person}\u2019s - a woman pouring out water, and a street scene. This makes 11 of his pictures which {B.|046|person} has seen, e. g., 1 at the Hague,  \n\n[0079]  \n1 in the {Rijks Museum|050|institution} here, 2 in the {Six Collection|062|collection} (4), 2 at {Dresden|063|city} (6), 1 at {Berlin|064|city} (7), 1 at {Frankfurt|065|city} (8), 1 in {Vienna|066|city} (9), 1 in the {Borghese|067|institution} (10), 1 in the {Louvre|068|institution} (11).  \nA wonderful {Rembrandt|019|person} ({portrait of Burgomaster Six|069|artwork (concept)}) done very much in {Franz Hals|024|person} manner. A splendid {Franz Hals|024|person} portrait of a man. Some {Cuyps|070|person}, {Terborgs|071|person}, {Jan Steens|021|person}, etc. A large {Paul Potter|028|person}, man on horseback, and a small one of cows.  \nRead {Motley|033|person} and de {Goncourt|007|person}. Enjoyed the {Palace|072|building}. {Dutch Renaissance|073|art movement}, very harmonious and nice. Studied {German|074|language}. Wrote letters. Sent \u201c{Maleine|036|literary work (concept)}\u201dto {Miss Bradley|075|person} and {Miss Cooper|076|person}.\n\n[080] Friday August 14. 1891.  \nRead {Motley|033|person} going to {Haarlem|077|city}. Spent 2 1/2 hours in the {Museum|025|institution}, studying {Frans Hals|024|person}, etc. We were perfectly fascinated with the two pictures nos. 77 & 78, painted in 1664- in a manner suggestive of {Zorn|078|person} and {Carri\u00e8re|079|person}, but even more modern than either! Compared him to {Shakespeare|080|person}. Also found figures and treatment which {Rembrandt|019|person} must have copied.  \nThe best {Terburg|071|person} - a {Family Group|081|artwork (concept)} - was painted very much like a {Courtois|082|person}. A landscape by {Van der Velde|083|person} was like a Hampstead Heath scene by {Constable|084|person} - but better! The {Cornelius van Haarlems|085|person} were all [081] interesting, and the pictures by {Jan de Braij|086|person}, while under {Frans Hals|024|person}\u2019 influence, were very good. A {Regents picture|087|artwork (concept)} by {Pot|088|person} was also extremely good, and some portraits by {Verspronck|089|person}.  \nCompared evolution of {Hals|024|person} to {Velasquez|090|person}, beginning where {Titian|009|person} left off.  \nWent to {Fodor Museum|091|institution} - an absolute fraud, 1 small {Meissonier|092|person} and a slight sketch  \nby {Watteau|093|person}.  \nWalked through {Ghetto|094|neighborhood}.  \nSaturday Aug. 15. 91.  \nA day in train from {Amsterdam|044|city} 9. 30 to {Hanover|095|city} 8. 50. Missed connections. Very hot and somewhat dusty.  \nRead {Motley|033|person} all day and studied {German|074|language}.  \n<BLOCKBREAK/>\n\n[082] Sunday August 16. 1891. {Brunswick|096|city}  \n\nCame from {Hanover|095|city} -studied {German|074|language} in train and began {Tolstoi|097|person}\u2019s \u201c{Wandelt im Licht|098|literary work (concept)}.\u201d{Gallery|099|institution} closed. Saw town and churches and very nice recent buildings in Renaissance style, i. e. - new {Schloss|100|building}, {Theater|101|venue}, {Police Court|102|building}, etc. In the {Dom|103|place} the tomb of {Henry the Lion|104|person} and {Matilda|105|person} his wife (done about 1200) was very remarkable and beautiful. Her face was particularly lovely, and as well modelled as anything Greek!! Found it hard to understand.  \nAt breakfast discussed the advantages, to a writer, of having no traditions to contend with - compared {Dumas fils|106|person} and {Ibsen|107|person}. {Tolstoi|097|person} and the {Russian novelists|108|group} with the {Americans|109|ethnic group}. Also the skill the rich get in objects of [083] household art, such as furniture, tapestry, carpets, etc., but the rarity of their becoming connoisseurs in the higher arts. {Goncourt|007|person} puts it perfectly in his entry for samedi, 20 f\u00e9vrier 1875 \u201cLes gens riches, il leur arrive parfois d\u2019avoir du go\u00fbt dans les porcelaines, dans les tapisseries, dans les meubles, dans les tabati\u00e8res, dans les objets d\u2019art industriel \u2026 il semble vraiment qu\u2019aux richaios, sauf de tr\u00e8s rares exceptions, est d\u00e9fendu le go\u00fbt de l\u2019art sup\u00e9rieur, - de l\u2019art fait par les mains, qui ne sont plus des mains d\u2019ouvrier.\u201d  \nThis is especially true of {Americans|109|ethnic group}, who really furnish their houses perfectly. However, they as buy good {French|110|ethnic group} pictures, or perhaps it is that they buy {French|110|ethnic group} pictures, and therefore can\u2019t help getting good ones.\n\n[in {Bernhard|046|person}\u2019s hand]  \n[084] Monday August 17. 9  \nWent to the {gallery|099|institution} in the forenoon, and found that a hail-storm a month ago had smashed the glass-roofs of the large halls, and that the pictures in them therefore were invisible. But we told the custodian we must see them even in the dark. He took us on tiptoe to the {Palma|111|person}, and left us at our request. As we were going out we bumped against two officials. Mutual surprise. They tried to be indignant, then assured us we had risked our lives, because glass was still falling from the roofs. Told them they must know well that when you [0087] come on purpose to see pictures you did not mind risking your life. That disarmed them, and the younger was liebensw\u00fcrdig enough to offer to take us through those same halls with a lantern.  \nIn this way we had a glimpse of two pictures that change one\u2019s idea of their painter. One is a portrait by {Rubens|010|person} painted with almost the readiness, and sweat of {Frans Hals|024|person}. Furthermore, it is the only portrait by {Rubens|010|person} I have seen in which {Rubens|010|person} sinks himself. The other picture is {Stien|112|person}\u2019s {Wedding-Contract|113|artwork (concept)}. The bride [088] and bride groom are charming beyond words.  \nOther things never to be forgotten are the {Vermeer|027|person} and some of the {Rembrandts|019|person}.  \nThe {Vermeer|027|person} had that wonderful purity and tenderness of colouring which makes his work seem so much like the finest porcelain. In this as in the other pictures, the same light blue, the same tints of sage and pea green, and the same effects of atmosphere.  \nThe most fascinating {Rembrandt|019|person} is the landscape. One would like to know where he got such a landscape. It is a scene for some strange mysterious tale in {Stevenson|114|person}\u2019s best fashion. Scarcely [089] less impressive is {Christ and the Magdalen|115|artwork (concept)}, neatly and clearly done, but treated in a wonderfully, religious way. The figure of {Christ|116|person} at any rate is full of that humility, and sense of wonder at his own self that {Rembrandt|019|person} more than once gives to the face and form of {Jesus|117|person}. The {Magdalen|118|person} is a {Dutch|017|ethnic group} woman of {Rembrandt|019|person}\u2019s own time. Very interesting also are two portraits of {Rembrandt|019|person}\u2019s earliest days, one of {Hugo Grotius|119|person}, a clean, fresh bit of painting, and one of {Grotius|119|person}\u2019 wife. Her portrait we should scarcely have known for [090] a {Rembrandt|019|person}. It is so firm and free from effects of atmosphere.  \nFinally I shall scarcely forget a little landscape by the elder {Vermeer|027|person}, a thing severe, quiet, with plenty of sky and spaciousness.  \nIn the afternoon we were in the fast express to {Berlin|064|city}, reading {Motley|033|person} and studying {German|074|language} as we rushed thro\u2019 the pretty towns, or past woods of white birch.  \n[0087-0088: small notes written by {Bernhard|046|person} using a fountain pen with an Italic nib]  \n[recto 0087]  \nSome people answer as if they were shutting the door with a bang.  \nMothers \u2026  \n[verso 0088]  \n{Primavera|120|artwork (concept)}. {Venus|121|person}-type of {Judith|122|person} and {Fortezza|123|person}, keys left hand as in latter. {Mercury|124|person} and all flesh tints as in {Sebastiano|125|person} of {Berlin|064|city}.  \nDrapery of {Venus|121|person} breasts and sleeves as in {Judith|122|person}.  \nWith this goes well the {Madonna with six saints|126|artwork (concept)}; in the hands are same.  \n{Michael|127|person} and {John Polagologos|128|person}.  \n\n{Feminine saint|129|person} of type of 3 dancing women. This is on way to coronation in the landscape as in {Venus|121|person} of ____.  \n[in left margin] Spirit same ____ as child in {Madonna with 6 saints|126|artwork (concept)}.  \n[from here on in {Mary|130|person}\u2019s hand]  \n[090] Tuesday Aug. 18. 91. {Berlin|064|city}  \nBreakfast at {Bauer\u2019s restaurant|131|restaurant}.  \nWent to {Gallery|099|institution} - - - - - - - - - - ! ! 10-3.  \nWalked in {Thiergarten|132|park}. Read {Layard|133|person}, etc., in the evening.\n\n[091] Wednesday, Aug. 19. 1891  \nWent early to {gallery|099|institution} and went carefully through the {Venetian School|134|art movement} from {Gentile da Fabriano|135|person} and {Antonio Vivarini|136|person} to {Tiepolo|137|person}. Also the {Veronese school|138|art movement}.  \nThursday August 20. 1891. {Berlin|064|city}  \n{Florentine School|139|art movement} at the {gallery|099|institution} - As we were looking at a fake \u201c{Pisanello|140|person}\u201d, an {American|109|ethnic group} young man asked why it was fake. We were too busy to stop, but we asked him to lunch. His turned out to be from {New Brunswick|141|city}, and his name was {Van Dyck|142|person} - a circumstance which naturally led him to take [092] an interest in pictures!! He had rather good taste, but he was oppressed with profound scepticism. He said that the pictures were all so repainted that the ascriptions were a mere matter of guess-work. In fine, he turned out to be the sort of person who knows too much to want to learn, and too little to teach, or even to sympathize. Went to the {Nationalgallerie|143|institution}.  \n{Herr Klinsmann|144|person} dined with us and we walked in the {Thiergarten|132|park}. We discussed the {Jews|145|ethnic group} in {Berlin|064|city}.  \nFriday. Aug. 21. 1891. {Berlin|064|city}  \n{Ferrarese|146|ethnic group} and {Milanese|147|ethnic group} Schools at the {Gallery|099|institution}. Went to {museum|025|institution} upstairs and [093] {Tschudi|148|person}\u2019s study.  \n{Herr Klinsmann|144|person} took us to the {International Exhibition|149|event}, where there were paintings by every school but the only good one, the {French|110|ethnic group}. {B\u00f6cklin|150|person} had an absurd \u201c{Susanna and the Elders|151|artwork (concept)}\u201d, as modern old ___ Jews. {Berenson|046|person} said he would like to see the {Bible|152|book} illustrated by {B\u00f6cklin|150|person}. The {Spanish|153|ethnic group} painters struck me as delightful, particularly {Villegas|154|person} and {Beuliure y Gil|155|person}.  \nCame from {Berlin|064|city} to {Dresden|063|city}. {Motley|033|person} and {German|074|language}.\n\n{Dresden|063|city} Saturday Aug. 22. 91. {Hotel Rheinischerhof|156|hotel}  \nWent to {gallery|099|institution} ------ !!  \nMet {Walter Cope|157|person}, {Signor Costa|158|person} and the {Hon.

Called on \u201c{Michael Field|162|person}\u201d and found them gone to the {hospital|163|institution}, {Miss Cooper|076|person} having the {Scarlet Fever|164|disease}. Poor things!  \nWent to {Das Rheingold|165|musical work (concept)} in the evening, and enjoyed it very much.  \n{Dresden|063|city} {Sunday|166|day} {August|167|month} {23|168|day} {1891|169|year}  \n{Gallery|099|institution} in morning with {Costa|158|person}. Read {Bonhomet Triboulet|170|literary work (concept)} by {Villiers de Lisle Adam|161|person}. x {Restaurant Gneist|171|restaurant} [added in blue ink]  \n\n{Dresden|063|city} {Monday|172|day} {August|167|month} {24|173|day}. 91.  \n{Gallery|099|institution} in morning. Called on {Michael Fields|162|person} at {Stadt Krankenhaus|174|institution} [095] where {Miss Cooper|076|person} is ill with {Scarlet Fever|164|disease}.

After lunch we started to walk to {Shaudan|199|place} but took a cul-de-sac road which landed us in a beautiful woodland temple. Walked back to {Rathen|200|place} and thence to {P\u00f6tscha|197|place}, just catching the train. The day was warm and fresh, and the sunlight enchanting. It was a day to remember all our lives. As we got off the train {B.|046|person} saw preparations which made him think they were about to commit a statue in the square.  \n[098] {Dresden|063|city}. {Aug|177|month}. {31|201|day}. 1891. {Monday|172|day}  \nWent to the {Gallery|099|institution} in morning and saw all the pictures, including {Dutch|017|ethnic group}.
